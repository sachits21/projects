"It's an old Cinderella story, what else is there to say? Jennifer Lopez was awesome like usual. She is probably the only reason why to see that movie. The soundtrack is great, nice music. It's better than just watching regular T.V.",1150675200,"06 19, 2006"
"Generally the story stinks.  Of course, it's offensively silly with Burt Reynolds in it.  But her character will get your empathy and your respect.  Good movies are studies of human nature, so that is what makes this movie good.",1415923200,"11 14, 2014"
OK movie. Not at the top of Wayne or O'hara's list.,1416096000,"11 16, 2014"
Bad movie. It was boring and predictable. I would not recommend it.,1414886400,"11 2, 2014"

I finally saw this movie and it was NOT a good movie.  It is supposed to be a romantic comedy but there was nothing romantic or funny about this movie.  It was dull and boring.  Don't believe those 5 star reviews. This movie should not be considered a classic.,1381622400,"10 13, 2013"
"Very dated (late '60's type of humor) but still worth watching if you absolutely love Woody Allen's sense of comedy and his self-loathing study in cinematic pathos. I purchased a used copy and don't feel cheated. Perhaps a Woody Allen diehard fan's must have, but for the average person, this might be one of those you don't really need to own - or view. I watched it expecting more, but realized I've become overly sophisticated in my appreciation for comedy over the last four decades.  It's paced like a television movie-of-the-week, and there are long pauses throughout. The narrative theme is 40's years pass, but interesting for anyone who remembers ""Tenspeed and Brownshoe"" growing up...",1316649600,"09 22, 2011"

Very good movie thank you,1509926400,"11 6, 2017"
Not good at all. The first movie was great. This was just weird slaughter garbage. Plot was horrid and I can watch some strange things. I would return of I wasn't a collector.,1435968000,"07 4, 2015"
A good film entertaining and good image quality,1411430400,"09 23, 2014"
"This director really has only one good movie - ""Event Horizon"" - and everything else is just plain bad, Resident Evil being absolutely no exception to this general rule of thumb and God help ""Aliens Vs Predator"" with the way things are shaping up.This film is marginally better than Ghosts of Mars, but only because Milla Jovovich goes around the place in a really very short mini-skirt and just happens to get skin sticking wet clothes towards the end of the picture. Overall the movie has extremely low production values and even lower prospects in the execution of the film. All of the sets looked contrived, i.e - they have no point being there other than to match scenes in the computer game or look interesting. Oh, yeah did we mention that this is based on a computer game? No, okay lets back up a bit here... Resident Evil just happens to be a really popular 3rd person zombie shoot 'em up horror survival game that they are now selling as a movie. Okay, let's move on...When the actors in this film are more robotic than the characters in the game then you know something has gone seriously wrong... and it has. Nobody in the cast is mildly recognizable except for Milla Jovovich, and they shouldn't be either, because they all suck real bad. The camera work is some of the worse seen in a long time. Why? Because it attracts attention itself almost all of time. Bad cinematography. For 35mm it looks like it was shot on video. The lighting is pretty good whenever it turns on or off but when it is static it is just useless. The editing is extremely bad at times and cuts fail to match. From an atheistic standpoint its all terrible production values for a Hollywood budget. The CGI also happens to be extremely, EXTREMELY, dodgy most of the times. You know when the animation looks like animation? Well x 100 times worse is what you get here. It looks terribly fake, and even the dogs covered in RED PAINT look very cheesy. Overall this is a really really really very bad production. The story is worse and even some of the.......Bah.Forget about me writing anymore. Not worth it. Just go play the game instead.",1075593600,"02 1, 2004"
"There have been a lot of mixed comments about this movie over the various review forums on the Net, (other than Amazon, which I have not read in depth). Some have really loved ""Fallen"" and some have particularly disliked it. For certain groups, there may be something to dislike. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and have since seen it many times.John Hobbes, (Washington), chasing a demonic serial killer is a great premise for a movie's plot, and something that has loads of potential to explore related themes. The movie does not scare you silly in the sense of making you jump with shock, (though in one place it does), but it more gives you a sense of forboding about what it is suggesting as possible: demons playing games with people and killing for fun. In this case, Azazel is the singing ""bad guy"" with an amazingly limited range of songs for someone over 10,000 years old, and is just having fun.Thought-provoking movies really are enjoyable, and this one certainly gives one a bit to think about. The only thing that I would have added to the movie, for which it had the potential, is more of the ""shock"" element. However, that is merely a personal taste, and certainly nothing to detract from the plot, the movie or the wonderful acting of the stars and cast.There are little clues throughout the movie, but not too many to give the game away to the viewer.As a supernatural thriller, ""Fallen"" is a fantastic story that is well told. If you are looking for something that will make you jump, sadly ""Fallen"" won't do that much. If you are just looking for a very disturbing and tense story with a twist, then ""Fallen"" is your thing. I loved it, simply put.",1116028800,"05 14, 2005"

"Not bad, dated of course, but the ending is a bit improbable.",1466726400,"06 24, 2016"
There are a few scares but not enough to make the movie a decent horror flick. An abrupt ending doesn't help it either.,1448409600,"11 25, 2015"
Just totally disliked it!,1473206400,"09 7, 2016"
"This movie wasn't bad. It is an odd little story and John Cusack really demonstrates some real acting chops here. Everyone else is pretty solid as well. In a word ""interesting.""",1377820800,"08 30, 2013"
"Yes Quick, wonderful and accurate",1396742400,"04 6, 2014"

"""The Unbearable Boredom of Watching.""  That's what this movie should have been titled.  It is a long, relentless, punishingly dull movie following the lives of three people intertwined by a common relationship with each other.  Two of them, Tomas and his mistress, Sabina, are talented yet shallow hedonists who seem to have no interest in pursuing anything greater or more meaningful than sexual gratification.  Tomas' young wife, Tereza, is a sad, pathetic, naive woman who is devoted to her husband despite her knowledge of his ongoing affair with Sabina.  The story takes place in the 1960's era of Communist oppression in Czechoslovakia.After spending about 3 hours watching this movie, one comes away struggling to find some meaning in it all.  There were opportunities to make an interesting movie -- the tension between the women who share a common lover, the impact of Communist oppression on the lives of Tomas and his wife are but two examples -- but the writers and director chose an incredibly boring and meaningless path instead.  There are several episodes of gratuitous sex, nudity, and a lengthy homoerotic scene between Sabina and Tereza that add nothing to the meaning, quality, or entertainment of this movie.I can really find no reason to recommend this movie.  If you are looking for a love story or a fascinating tale about interesting people and their lives, you will be sorely disappointed.  Only someone who can find meaning watching the clothes dryer at a laundromat would find this movie interesting.",1140739200,"02 24, 2006"
Didn't realize when I chose to watch the movie that it was in Chinese.  Could very well be a good movie but I couldn't watch and read at the same time to enjoy the movie.,1400457600,"05 19, 2014"
"Trashy in some ways. My husband wanted to see it because it was a Navy flick, but it has a lot of foul language. Personally I didn't like it, but he did. I wouldn't recommend for family viewing because of language.",1446249600,"10 31, 2015"

This is a good movie but everything goes in slow motion. I think I was expected more and that messed it all up. It is not a bad movIe but I was looking for a little more action than it occurred.,1448409600,"11 25, 2015"

"This review is NOT about the movie as it is five plus stars. It is about the blu ray from Twilight Time. I have the DVD and just received the blu ray. For some unknown reason Columbia Pictures never issued this as a blu ray, so Twilight Time did. Normally I have been pleased with Twilight Time releases (HINT: all their releases are far far cheaper on their website, as I just found) as well as Criterion Collection releases. Honestly, Criterion is the best of all of them...Criterion, Twilight, Shout! Factory and Scream! Factory.This is FAR FAR from a blu ray. I still own the DVD release and will continue to do so. There is absolutely NO difference between the blu ray and the Columbia DVD both in video and audio. I mean NONE. In fact, the blu ray is darker in tone then is the DVD. The darker tone does not account for a richer deeper picture, it is just dark. The DVD has a much brighter picture and the color at times appears sharper.Perhaps there is a reason why Columbia never issued this as a blu ray. If their reason was because the negative would not transfer well, I certainly understand--as it clearly does not.",1507161600,"10 5, 2017"

"About the same as a lot of the movies made in this style of ""real"" but not really real.  Acting is okay, plot is fairly typical.  I did enjoy it but..  Good for a night when nothing else is on.",1357776000,"01 10, 2013"
very trite,1478908800,"11 12, 2016"

"There's no bigger fan of The Bob Newhart Show than me. Well, with the possible exception of my wife.We just watched episodes from Season Two this morning, in fact, at which time we said, ""It's really a shame the rest of the serious isn't available on DVD.""So I looked this morning and discovered - lo and behold! - that the complete series will be released in May.IT'S ABOUT TIME!And...THANK YOU, NAMELESS TV EXECS!Who cares if we already own Seasons 1-4? Honestly, what difference does it make? if getting the rest of these brilliant TV series on DVD means I have to re-buy Seasons 1-4 I'm more than happy to do so.Quite complaining, people! For Pete's sake! Just be thankful that somebody in one of these networks had the brains to do what we've all wanted done for so many years.""Hi, Bob.""""Hi, Howard.""""Hi, Emily.""Bring it on!",1394323200,"03 9, 2014"
"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer takes place one year after the events of I Know What You Did Last Summer. Julie is now in college, taking Summer classes in Boston; trying to avoid Southport to put the past behind her. The past still haunts her on a regular basis however as she constantly has visions and dreams of the murderous, vengeful fisherman, Ben Willis coming after her.That afternoon, Julie and her best friend, Karla win tickets for 4 for a getaway to the Bahamas for 4th of July weekend via radio station call-in after answering the question of the capital of Brazil correctly.....or incorrectly. While Karla brings her boyfriend, Tyrell along on the trip; Julie plans on asking Ray, her boyfriend from the previous film to come along, but he initially declines out of frustration of her refusing to visit him in Southport. With Ray's ticket now on the table, Karla brings along her best friend, Will, who has a crush on Julie---and off they go!Once the 4 arrive in the Bahamas, they discover that others have left due to a tropical storm on the way. With it just being the 4 of them plus hotel staff, things seem to go great so far...until Julie begins receiving mysterious notes, reminding her of ""what she did"" and until the staff and crew begin getting gruesomely killed off one by one by a familiar hooded figure with a hook for a hand. What Julie hoped to be a peaceful and relaxing Summer has now turned into another hellacious nightmare. Some things you just can't bury.Overall: This was an okay sequel. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer moves away from the suspenseful thriller kind of movie that viewers witnessed in its predecessor and transitions to more of a slasher horror. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprise their roles from the first film as the couple of Julie and Ray. Logic doesn't seem to play much of a factor in this movie which definitely deducts stars from this rating. For example the entire radio call-in scene is questionable in terms of answering the question correctly. Also, Julie is constantly receiving reminders saying ""I know what you did last Summer""; but in this case, shouldn't have been 2 Summers ago, considering that's when it all started? Or is the killer now mad about supposedly getting killed off last Summer? I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is one of those movies that have you asking too many questions throughout the duration of the film. The acting is subpar on certain levels as well. This would mark the last of the I Know What You Did films to feature any of the original cast and crew as a third sequel released in 2006 titled ""I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer (avoid at all costs) featured a fresh new cast. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer gets a B+ in terms of gore and kills but the movie overall deserves a C - or maybe even a D",1410220800,"09 9, 2014"
"Another twists-for-the-sake-of-twists movie, many of which don't make any sense. Gives away some of it's punches way too early. Decent acting but not much else.",1409529600,"09 1, 2014"
Ok,1437523200,"07 22, 2015"
It's funny but this is the least of my favorites of Wes Anderson movies. It's an early one of his work. It has his humor and worth seeing but there's better ones of his movies out there!!,1434412800,"06 16, 2015"

"I gave this a one star because I am not allowed to put ZERO. This movie is a complete waste of time. After 15 minutes of viewing I stopped the movie because it was so bad. The following day I watched the rest of the movie because I thought it would get better. I was so WRONG. Everything about this movie is bad. The acting is atrocious, the story simplistic and juvenile, the set, directing etc. was horrible.

"If you're looking for a great horror movie with an eerie back drop, flesh eating zombies and plenty of blood you're definitely looking in the wrong place! The eerie mansion backdrop of the video game is completely absent instead replaced by an over stylized laboratory and the basic premise of the game (survival horror) is thrown out of the window.Instead you get a bunch of incompetent special forces jerks who have no personality and seem to not think of trying a headshot when the people they shoot get back up after emptying entire magazines into them. This movie plays more like a crappy matrix remake with zombies delivering neck-breaking and kung-fu kicks galore instead of horror. Another thing there's no blood when they shoot 'em in the head just a shot of the gun going off and a quick cut to the tiny bullet hole on the forehead of the zombie; no forehead squibbs!The best thing about this movie is Milla Jovovich gets naked. You can even tell that some of the background in the mess hall tank sequence are 2-D paintings. As for any campy fun, none to speak of; very low gore it's mostly sterile CG stuff, the zombies just seem to nibble not taking a single bloody chunk out of anybody and in my opinion if you can't see it free of charge, don't.",1028937600,"08 10, 2002"

They try different things with more or less success, worst of all (in my opinion) being the cartoonish monster episode that is way off the path of the traditional X-Files.

"I have to confess that I don't play video games - eye-hand coordination and lightning reflexes weren't included in my genetic package, so this review is based on the movie - and nothing but the movie.Other than Milla Jovovich, no cast member did any real acting.  Michelle Rodriguez had a fairly difficult role to play, but the snarling and eye rolling was just too much at times.  She was necessarily tough, but the dialogue also really let her down. The rest of the cast was on par for a B Grade horror movie, and only slightly more animated than the zombies.This movie is what happens when you mix too many good things in a haphazard way. Imagine trying to write a coherent script when your ""must"" list includes zombies, were-dogs, sloppy genetic mutations with long tongues, a controlling computer system, an impregnable ""fortress"", a knockout babe with amnesia, a SWAT team, biological warfare, viruses, spies and saboteurs, a battle on a train, and guns - lots of guns.The zombie scenes failed to impress, no gore to be seen anywhere - they just looked like a typical crowd of people in the mosh pit at a rock concert.  The mutating tissue-thing was straight out of a Dean Koontz book, and most of the suspense scenes weren't very suspenseful, because whatever you expected to happen - did.On the cool side, you had the wicked lasers to do the slicing and dicing, Alice's (Milla) hot red zombie-kicking slit-way-up the side dress, and the fight scenes.  Many parts may seem familiar, mainly because you've seen scenes just like them in other popular action movies.Next time let Alice do some Mortal Kombat with Lara Croft and you can call it a Final Fantasy.Amanda Richards, February 22, 2005",1109030400,"02 22, 2005"

"I don't know about the video game but I don't have to know about it and to be a bright one to see that the conceptors of the game were inspired by George Romero's cinema.Take Romero's excellent movie, ""Day of the Dead"" (the third and last film in his zombi trilogy), add to it a big budget, plenty of computers and special effects and a couple of female stars, in order to grab the required audience, and you get that kind of predigested movie, that you forget as soon as you see it. The story is practically the same: a handful of characters trapped by a bunch of zombies in a closed, underground place, and who quickly slander each other for survival. ""Resident Evil"" is unfortunately typical of today's American action cinema: it's empty, noisy and brainless, in one word, standard. More than the story, totally trivial today - the virus theme has been told a hundred times, and in better, especially in ""Twelve Monkeys"" and in Richard Matheson's founder novel, ""I am Legend"" -, the biggest default of this film is the total lack of gore scenes, which is paradoxical for a zombie movie and the symptom of a politically correct U.S. cinema. Milla Jovovich is not very comfortable, the music, uselessly hard, is deafening and brings bad headache (but this is the fashion today), the beginning is totally taken from Vincenzo Natali's ""Cube"" and the ending, from John Carpenter's ""In the Mouth of Madness"".This disastrous movie (but what could you expect from the director of pitiful ""Mortal Kombat"", also based upon a video game?) is a good proof that money and technology don't always do good to cinema.A last point: it's George Romero himself who was first supposed to direct the movie. But he was put away after he brought a script we may suppose as 'gore' - and good - as his previous zombi works... Shame on the deciders! And shame on the finally chosen director! Your movie is a waste!",1066176000,"10 15, 2003"

"He has ever had passion to explore some aspects of women, but now he's a ""grown up"". I don't want to see Englishmen, Americans and French themselves playing French in a movie describing history facts, we can not find THE REASON France fought with England when those emotions has been confused a lot. Though I like Milla Jovovich, always. About French's madness, if you are interested in it's beauty and mystery (in this movie, it is expressed little and not so completely), I recommend ""Beatrice"" and ""the ninth gate""(but I've ever seen few French movies). Notice how those people betray God; the ways are funny sometimes and beautiful sometimes, though are cruel (cruelty is based on despair) the same time, of course. I don't know how successful the two movies are, in trying to touch the thought of God, since I myself do not really understand God and find it is hard to understand a little more; at least I am sure they are closer than this one.",1007251200,"12 2, 2001"

"Why do some directors and writers of horror movies think it's fair to completely annoy their audiences with these ambiguous endings, so that even though you may have enjoyed the movie, you hate the resolution!  It's such  a cop out.  It's like they're telling you, the third in the series is  coming out.  Unfortunately, this particular series should probably stop.  I  liked the first movie a lot; it was suspenseful, imaginative, and pretty  scary.  The acting was generally better too.  This time around, the acting  and script are pretty irritating.  First of all, anyone who knows their  geography will get a big clue early in the film.  Secondly, Freddie  Prinze's character is such a jerk in the beginning, you can't believe his  sudden transformation.  Third, I figured out the villain very early in the  film, so there was little suspense.  The acting overall is lame; Jennifer  Love Hewitt has decided to join Neve Campbell in the ""I'm only doing  this for the money, and I'm really wasting my time in this silly horror  movie.""  She does look a lot like Kate Jackson in this one, though.  Freddie Prinze is absolutely awful, completely unconvincing, and a pretty  shoddy hero, to boot.  The guy who plays Titus is an offensive,  stereotypical insult to intelligent viewers, providing none of the comic  relief the director obviously wanted.  Jeffrey Combs, who was so good in  the ""Reanimator"" movies looks as bored as Miss Hewitt, and does  nothing to pad his resume.  Three actors do manage to rise above their  material:  Jennifer Esposito as Nancy, the barmaid is very good; Brandy is  surprisingly effective as Julie's best friend, although her character does  become annoying and stupid; and Matthew Settle as the good-natured Bill is  very effective.  I still think Gorton's should sue for using their  fisherman image, but it is a horror movie.  That's what so sad.  It could  have been a lot better, but it's too predictable and a little too gory, as  well.  When all is said and done, ""Halloween"" and ""A  Nightmare on Elm Street"" (the first in the series) are still the  benchmarks for modern horror movies!",962582400,"07 3, 2000"
I had seen this movie many years ago and now that I have a copy for my collection I am very pleased.  This is a terrific movie and it is as effective today as it was when it first came out.

"The Hives set up by the influential Umbrella Corporaton has been secretly conducting genetic experiments and the subterranean lab has unfortunately been plagued by a viral outbreak, taking its toll on the working staff. It is up to Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez with the assistance of cop Eric Mabius to confront and isolate the virus. Accompanying them is an elite task force - and the situation is critical with the time factor going against them. They have to reach the Red Queen, the mother of the computer network that powers and defend the Hive.Unless you are a computer fanatic of the popular Capcom game and its spawned 3 sequels or wanting to get a thrill from seeing the protagonists battling terrifying obstacles through the dark labyrinths, you might want to spare yourself from surviving a horrible movie.It is a splatter of unnecessary gore with decapitated corpses and mindless violence that desensitized rather than offer true scares. The phalanx of cannibals and vampire-like troops eating people alive and animatronic creatures like Licker, Zombie Dogs doesn't exactly fascinate either. Paul WS Anderson who also helmed the cheesy Mortal Kombat makes a movie that is stocked full of grunge rock to compensate for its lack of atmosphere.The only saving grace of the movie is Milla Jovovich hiking up the kick... factor with her resilient mantle. Otherwise the movie is a sputtering mess - and it's a shame when horror-chiller George A Romero of the famed Living Dead trilogy inspired this movie. Resident Evil is butchered unscrupulously into a gore flick which is shockingly horrible instead of terrifying.",1017619200,"04 1, 2002"

"First of all let me just say that this movie has the worst anticlimatical ending of all time: there's no verbal or telepathic communications established with the aliens, no sense of what their intentions are, no reason mentioned for why they've abducted people, no reason to explain why Richard Dreyfuss' character is the ""chosen one"", and worst of all we (the audience) are left to believe that a stupid little hand gesture means that everything is all hunky-dory with the aliens- case closed, everything is all right with the aliens because Steven Spielberg says so. Don't worry about cattle mutilations or any of those other violent abductions you've been hearing about, everything's all fine and dandy.The first half of the movie was good, but for some reason they decided to turn it into some watered-down, cheesy, leave-the-audience-feeling-secure kind of movie during the last half. Another reviewer mentioned the movie 2001 and compared it to Close Encounters, all I have to say is that they're completely different from each other- one has a philosophical message and one doesn't. Basically this movie is for those who wanna lie to themselves and say that there's nothing to worry about. 2001 is definitely the movie to see if your interested in aliens- im not saying it's real (who knows though?), but its sure more engaging than Close Encounters.",972259200,"10 23, 2000"
"I agree the the reviewer's comments that Daniels is miscast as Washington. No one would take him for a Virginian; rather like the old Disney production of the Swamp Fox played by a young Lesley Nielson with a New York accent. Also Welsh actor Roger Rees with an English accent plays the Scottish general Hugh Mercer who had to flee Scotland for supporting Prince Charlie.One of the worst and unexcused errors is when Washington asks after the battle: ""how many killed?"" ""None"" (correct). ""How many wounded?""  ""none"". Incorrect. There were four wounded one of whom, the most seriously wounded was a young lieutenant in the 3rd Virginia named James Monroe. Fifth president of the United States. Worth mentioning I would think.",1284336000,"09 13, 2010"

Worst Hallmark Movie I have ever seen! The characters say things and make comments that are very trashy and not consistent with the time period. The main female character has no morals and by the end of the movie the main male character just accepts her because he hasn't been with a woman in 3 years. There is no obvious change for the good in the characters and no lessons learned. I would not consider this family friendly,1446336000,"11 1, 2015"
"I was sorely disappointed with this movie. I loved it when I was a kid, but after watching it for the first time since it was in theatres, I just wasn't impressed at all. I saw the DVD and couldn't resist, but I wish I would have. This has got to be one of the slowest movies I've ever seen. Spielberg never has been too impressive in my opinion, but this is pathetic. At least Jaws and E.T. have some action throughout the entire movie. Here you get a small glimpse of the alien happenings at the beginning, 1.25 hours of boredom, and an ending that just wasn't nearly as good as it was when I was kid. My kids couldn't stand it, so it's obviously not a timeless classic, like the other space/alien movies of the late 70s early 80s.",1002758400,"10 11, 2001"

"This movie was a big let-down. I LOVED the first two Mummy movies in the series and could watch them over and over. This one was written so bad that the lines could be laughed at throughout the entire thing (and I don't mean the comedic lines). The wife is a different person and is awful, son talks like John Wayne and is too old compared to the years that went by, and Jet Li was barely in the movie/had any lines. The special effects in this movie were mediocre in 1995 and that's saying something. The story of it completely broke off from what it was in the first two. The wife has no connection to her past like in the second one whatsoever. I would not recommend this to anyone that loves the first two. If you don't want to ruin the series and have not seen this movie, then don't even think about watching this. I have never been so disappointed in a movie.",1226448000,"11 12, 2008"

"This ""Film"" version of the classic story by Charlotte Bronte is grossly overacted by Ciaran Hinds. Personally, I found him to be too harsh and cruel, barely even nice. However, Samantha Morton balanced it out quite well as the title character, though. I also didn't like the omission of the middle scenes with Mrs. Reed, which I feel are very important to the story. I prefer Timothy Dalton (4 years before he embodied the role of James Bond in ""The Living Daylights"") as Rochester. He was very well suited to the part; I read somewhere that he considers his role as Edward Rochester his personal favourite. Gemma Jones (""Sense & Sensibility"") was great as Mrs. Fairfax. If you're looking for a faithful version of ""Jane Eyre,"" I highly recommend the 1983 BBC miniseries starring Timothy Dalton, the 1944 version starring Orson Welles or the 1996 version starring William Hurt. This film version is Not Rated.",1249603200,"08 7, 2009"

"Ok, the first half of this movie was some of the best cinema I have ever seen.  The brother and sister characters had such great chemistry you really cared about both of them.  The scene on that country road was beautiful, and that filthy old truck coming up on them was enough to grab anyone's attention.  I was hooked.  But up until the time you discover who the driver of that truck is, and the mystery lady who's sole point was to explain to the audience where this thing came from and what its purpose was, it lost me.  I would still by this dvd however, I truly cannot watch it until the end it is laughable.  I give it an extra star for the first half of the film, that great truck, and the scene under the church.  Imagine if the driver of that truck would not have been what it actually was but instead a crazed serial killer with an interesting background.  I know there are those who would disagree with me and I say to them I loved the first half of this film, but the 2nd half didn't do it for me but I would still recommend it on a night when you want to see something somewhat interestingly creepy.",1135468800,"12 25, 2005"

"As George Jung, Johnny Depp dons long blonde hair, a Boston accent and dark glasses. He portrays a man, who fearing poverty as a boy, makes all the wrong choices in obtaining wealth - first as a marijuana importer and finally as the kingpin in the rise of the cocaine empire.  Because he is a decent sort of fellow, not a monster, he is ousted by his Latin American contacts and winds up three times in prison, where he remains today, serving a sixty year sentence, until his planned release in 2015.It isn't until 42 minutes into the two hour film that cocaine even enters the picture (suggested by his cell mate during his first stay in prison, once he learns of George's marijuana empire). Jordi Molla as the cell mate, Diego, delivers the best performance in the film. He is riveting in all of his guises as friend, confidante, opportunity provider, and ultimate betrayer.  Equally good in support are Rachel Griffiths as George's loud mouthed, bitter mother and Ray Liotta as his long loving and long suffering father - a poignant betrayal.Unfortunately, the film has little value other than providing a history lesson in the rise of cocaine as an underworld marketing empire.  TRAFFIC is an interesting companion film to see.  Depp is most affecting in his last scenes, now sporting a paunch and dirty long hair, delusionally expecting his daughter's visit, an event which never occurs.The problem with the film in my opinion is that it lacks tension - it is too matter of fact.  We never see George's ambition - he is always too calm about everything that happens to him, good and bad.  We care about him but we don't engage with his character.  It is a marketing lie to show Penelope Cruz as his co-star. She doesn't appear in the film until the second half and then only in a few scenes as his second wife, a foul-mouthed five letter word.To sum up, it's a valuable history lesson but not great film.",1194739200,"11 11, 2007"
"No one i repeat no one can say or not say that there ae rules for punk rock. Punk is not what you wear it's not anarchy it's not something you can call yourself by having a mowhawk!!! it's a way of life it's an expression it is something that has been ruined by the media and hollywood. This has to be the most ignorant movie i have ever seen, and if people actually buy into it than thats their own fault. I was briefly entertained, but the simple fact that steve-o has set rules to be a punk rocker is bull-sh*t. I cant have a girfriend im a punk rocker. I can't be a sellout, so that means i can't like english bands?Rules are for your so called establishment, not for an anarchist. This movie is a giant oxymoron. Just the fact that steve-o comes from an upper class family contradicts his own moronic beleifs. go out and watch into  hell.

"This movie is very powerful and is certainly deserving of its Top 100 AFI rating.  This is the story of madness and the slow decent into criminal violence that it leads Taxi Driver Bickle when he sees it as the only way out of a hopeless situation.  Loneliness can be a terrible thing to deal with and while most people struggle with it and choose a more conventional and healthy solution others with mental illness or who are prone to it ""choose"" different paths that may lead to self-destruction or as in the case of Travis Bickle, vigilante-ism and taking the law into his own hands to set things ""right.""  The lonely angry psychopath who reacts in this way is the ticking time bomb that unfortunately is almost never recognised until the effects of their madness come to fruition e.g. the Unabomber etc.  DeNiro does an excellent job in portraying this individual and is genuinely scary in his role; even scarier is the realisation that perhaps at some point in our lives the vast majority of us have at least contemplated taking things into our own hands and so to some extent perhaps even identify and even find ourselves rooting for Travis.  The violent end may have shocked 70s audiences and you get the sense that Scorcese even toned it down a little for fear of a public backlash but it's interesting to me that as violence in film has been getting worse and worse over the years, I felt that it was pretty tame given what we are exposed to these days e.g ""Kill Bill"", ""Blade"" etc and I thought the final scenes were not violent enough relative to today's films.  Ironically, Bickle is treated as a hero and is not punished for his murders in the end which is also interesting as this ticking time bomb is released into the streets in an ominous ending which leaves us expecting a sequel of some sort.  I would like to see a Director's Cut of this movie and to see how Scorcese would ""modernise"" this brilliant film for today's audiences.  In my opinion, this is the best film since ""Midnight Cowboy"" to expose the seady side of the 70s New York City underbelly although it is just as powerful a film for its impact on its audience.This dvd version of the film though is a bit of a mixed bag as although the picture and sound quality have been cleaned up the sound quality in 2 channels isn't very good and I'm glad that in the newer 2-Disc and upcoming Blu-ray versions you'll get the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound option which I hope sounds much better than what we get here.  The picture quality isn't perfect as a few frames here and there have spots and other imperfections on them but I thought it was done well enough to not detract from the overall viewing enjoyment.  The Special Features includes a good making-of documentary with interviews with Scorcese and the cast.Overall this is a great study into the lone, crazed anti-hero and is certainly one of the better films that I've ever seen.  You may however want to give this particular dvd version a miss and go instead for either the Blu-ray or the other 2-disc standard version with the improved sound quality.Updated 1 July 2011: 4 stars.Amazon won't let me review this separately and so I'll do it here.  The blu-ray release of this wonderful Scorcese classic is a treat for fans as it certainly improves upon the dvd release that I reviewed above.  The digipak packaging with a number of colour postcards is very nice.  The all important picture and sound quality have also improved a great deal although the picture quality isn't perfect as there is still excessive grain in some parts especially in the scene in the brothel when DeNiro first speaks with Foster as well as in other spots but it is still an improvement over the dvd.  The sound quality is now in excellent surround mode and is the aspect most improved over the dvd version.Not perfect picture quality-wise but still worth the double-dip.Recommended!",1229817600,"12 21, 2008"

"While it is mostly Biblically accurate, nevertheless this is a very lackluster re-telling, being obviously low-budget. The most dramatic and emotional scene for me was when Mary Magdalene's tears fell on Jesus's feet and she wiped them with her hair. The scourging scene lacked any impact, probably not to horrify the audience. According to evidence from the Holy Shroud of Turin and the witness of several Catholic mystics, His scourging was absolutely heart-rending in its horror. Of course, this being an obvious Protestant production, they gave short shrift to Jesus's mother, Mary! Maybe that is why they chose Luke, instead of using material from Matthew, Mark or John!!! I guess what I am looking for is a good Catholic rendering. Any good Catholic out there have about $100,000,000 (or possibly less), as I am ready to do it right!!!",988588800,"04 30, 2001"

We have watched this movie every year since it came out so I thought it was about time to buy it on DVD.  It never gets old even though we can all say the dialogue along with the characters and sing the songs too.  Our kids are now 18 & 16 and this is still the first Christmas movie they want to watch!Merry Christmas!,1377648000,"08 28, 2013"

"This is a video of a one-person play done expertly by Julie Harris. Don't expect a movie of the life of the poet. It allowed for different camera angles, so interest is maintained. If you like exceptional stage acting, you will find it here.",1440633600,"08 27, 2015"

"I rented the film for $1.99 because I found the sale price way too high.  It's a charming, funny, lighthearted spoof of the secret agent genre.  I'm a big Michael Crawford fan and this is the only work available where he's not lost in the character like Forum or Dolly. I wish he'd done more film work post-Phantom of the Opera. He has a true gift for comedy.",1287532800,"10 20, 2010"
I hate being the one to say that the book was so much better but in this case it was. This movie just cut out way to much. If I hadn't read the book I would have had very little Idea as to what was going on in this movie.,1456617600,"02 28, 2016"

"I first saw this film when I was eleven. My father taped it, and when I was thirteen, I watched the tape again and again. Being that young, I could not understand the symbolism involved, I simply knew that the movie was ""beautiful."" Each time I watched ""A River Runs Through It"", it grew in me, as if I felt a deeper sense of spiritual awakening just from seeing the movie. Now I am 21 years old and an English major, so the symbolism is much clearer.In the film, there are two brothers, Paul and Norman. The father, the Reverend MacLean teaches the two brothers how to cast a fishing rod. The two learned to cast with a four count rhythm, with a metronome playing. The narrator Norman says of his father: ""If he had had his way, no one who did not know how to catch a fish, would be allowed to disgrace a fish by catching it."" It becomes clear that this simple way to catch fish, using a four count rhythm, is graceful. If a fly-fisherman swings his rod too powerfully, it might become stuck in some trees. If he swings too weakly, it will never go into the stream where the fish are biting. But the four count rhythm method of casting, is ""just right.""Paul is a rebellious, golden-haired youth. His rebellion starts early when he refuses to eat his porridge. He gets into a fight with his older brother Norman, but all is forgiven. The next day, Norman watches his little brother break free of his father's ""four count rhythm."" He has rebelled into something courageous and original. Though despite its own unique beauty, its gracefulness is different than Norman and his father. It has less control. He calls it ""shadow casting"" later in life. Like the ""shadow casting"" Paul's life has less structure than Norman's.Norman has always had that spiritual grace that comes with swinging the rod just right. It's almost as if he has spiritual gifts as well as his academic ones. (Norman receives a masters degree and becomes a professor.)Paul's spiritual gifts are no less important, but they are not sustainable, because they lack the discipline and the structure of Norman. Despite his sad outcome, Paul's fishing and his life are ""beautiful."" They are beautiful because you can love them ""completely, without complete understanding.""I wish other films were made now like this one. It is extremely effective as a spiritual project because it not only conveys the message, but the viewer feels the message, the way I had when I was thirteen. It inspired me to stay in my best structure, like Norman had.",1136073600,"01 1, 2006"

"Fright Night is one of the better vampire films from the 80's.  The special effects are gruesome and scary yet the movie is also sexy and fun too.  Yes it's from the 80's and it shows in a few places, but the movie still holds up very well today.  This movie was released in limited edition Blue-ray back in 2011.  The picture and sound of this edition look great.  The only thing keeping me from giving this edition 5 stars is the lack of extras.  They should have put a little more effort into this edition.  Audio commentary, deleted scenes, and retrospective interviews with the cast and film makers would have been nice.",1330214400,"02 26, 2012"

"At least, that's what he has implied by ruining both Resident Evil and Aliens vs. Preditor. Why oh why did Sony choose him over George Romero? He had a script ready to go, and then Anderson walked in and offered to do it for less money, and that was that. The same thing can be said about Aliens vs. Preditor. Dream projects like AVP and RE will never be safe so long as Paul Anderson is making movies.If you want the real Resident Evil expirience, I suggest you play the remake of the first game on Gamecube. If you desire a non-interactive adaptation of the games, read the books. If you must see just how badly Anderson botched up the RE mythology, then by all means see the movies. But be forwarned, they suck. What could have been an excellent horror film adaptation of a classic game turned into a C grade action movie flop.",1094947200,"09 12, 2004"

"I'm not a videogame nut, so I guess I missed this film's 'good' points.  The only redeeming qualities ""Resident Evil-Apocalypse"" has going for it are CGI effects and stunts.  Nonexistent plot, lousy dialogue (lots of cursing), women running around half or completely naked (while all the men are fully clothed).  Even the zombies were far better done in the recent remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"".  Milla Jovovich has yet to make an impression on me in any film she has been in.Movies like this one seem to assume that videogame devotees aren't intelligent enough to deal with such things as decent story, good acting, etc.  Judging by some reviews on this site, maybe the producers of 'Apocalypse' are right.  1 star, and that's stretching it.",1104278400,"12 29, 2004"

"The Hives set up by the influential Umbrella Corporaton has been secretly conducting genetic experiments and the subterranean lab has unfortunately been plagued by a viral outbreak, taking its toll on the working staff. It is up to Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez with the assistance of cop Eric Mabius to confront and isolate the virus. Accompanying them is an elite task force - and the situation is critical with the time factor going against them. They have to reach the Red Queen, the mother of the computer network that powers and defend the Hive.Unless you are a computer fanatic of the popular Capcom game and its spawned 3 sequels or wanting to get a thrill from seeing the protagonists battling terrifying obstacles through the dark labyrinths, you might want to spare yourself from surviving a horrible movie.It is a splatter of unnecessary gore with decapitated corpses and mindless violence that desensitized rather than offer true scares. The phalanx of cannibals and vampire-like troops eating people alive and animatronic creatures like Licker, Zombie Dogs doesn't exactly fascinate either. Paul WS Anderson who also helmed the cheesy Mortal Kombat makes a movie that is stocked full of grunge rock to compensate for its lack of atmosphere.The only saving grace of the movie is Milla Jovovich hiking up the kick... factor with her resilient mantle. Otherwise the movie is a sputtering mess - and it's a shame when horror-chiller George A Romero of the famed Living Dead trilogy inspired this movie. Resident Evil is butchered unscrupulously into a gore flick which is shockingly horrible instead of terrifying.",1017619200,"04 1, 2002"

"Just not really worth watching.  I was impressed with Anderson's british accent, but who really cares about that.  Not what I would call a revenge movie, but that is the only thing it attempts, so I would call it a failure.

This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.  The acting was awful and they got the story line all wrong.  There is a much better version that came out years ago with Kirk Cameron and the acting was far better and they were much closer to the story line. It was a disappointment.,1424822400,"02 25, 2015"
This movie is really funny. A lot of folks think that you must be into Heavy Metal... to enjoy this film. They are sadly mistaken this movie is great. I have had many folks who are into Opera and Country music see this movie and they love it. One of the funniest movies of all time!

"This isn't a bad zombie movie, but then again it isn't a good one either. Although one knows what to expect in such a movie,any kind of plot usually keeps things exciting. In this casehowever the plot is not particularly interesting. As so many people get slaughtered during the first 20 minutes, we theviewers do not really care anymore about a little girl getting saved or not. Milla Jovovitch's stunt fights are surreal and her battle with Nemesis, clearly a distant relative of an Uruk-Hai from Lord of the rings, looks silly. I think this movie is unlucky that the crowd's appetite for zombie movies is starting to temper a little. We now want a reasonable story as well.Just shooting zombies isn't enough anymore. Shame about this movie though, as it obviously is a lot better than the previous part. This just looks like a wasted opportunity.(SARR)",1131840000,"11 13, 2005"

"A classic not only of thoughtful science fiction in the tradition of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", but of cryptic suggestion: Dozens of threads are tied together only slowly, as the viewer gains slowly  more and more access to the facts.

Ultimately, the lack of compelling writing is whats keeps this movie from being great.

"""For Roseanna"" is a wonderfully sweet romantic comedy about a loving husband and his devotion to his dying wife. The film is full of charismatic performances, but Jean Reno steals the show by a narrow margin. Mercedes Ruehl is also warm and lovely in the title role. For a story so focused on the subject of death, the character of Marcello is the embodiment of vitality, and his various efforts to keep his fellow townsmen alive so they don't take up the last graves in the village cemetery are hilarious. Having seen Reno more typically in dramatic roles in movies such as ""The Professional,"" ""Mission: Impossible,"" and ""Ronin,"" I was impressed with the very gifted comic range that he demonstrates here. With very fine talented supporting performances from Polly Walker, Trevor Peacock, Renato Scarpa, Roberto Della Casa, and Mark Frankel (tragically, his final performance), this is a little jewel of a movie. Don't miss it.",1328832000,"02 10, 2012"

"We were disappointed.  Normally we love the Arthur movies...but the title to this one was off base.  Should have been called Stressful Winter Celebrations and how to make them all blend.  If it's a Christmas movie, then stick to the topic.  Let us know more about those traditions and customs.  Sounded more like ""let's just not make Christmas that big a deal"", was the theme.  Would love to have heard more about what the spirit of Christmas is really all about.  Why do we celebrate it?  That's what really makes it perfect.  (This was more about being politically correct.  Downplay Christmas and pull in all the other holidays)  I'm a retired teacher and I always enjoyed teaching about all of the winter holidays.  But each one got it's own presentation....including Christmas.",1419465600,"12 25, 2014"

This movie was terrifying at points and followed the book only in the most basic way.  I do not recommend this for kids under the age of 10.  The music was terrible as the banter between the boy and the bugs was boring.  I don't understand how they managed to ruin such a great book.  Tim Burton is a producer and you can tell but this is the only redeeming quality.  I truly wish we had not bothered with this film.,1442707200,"09 20, 2015"

I've been wanting to see this film again after seeing it many years ago. It was as good as I remembered it. Heart-breaking yet humorous at times. Quite intense and poignant. Raises important questions of humanity and the meaning of life and personal freedom. Certainly makes one think.,1373414400,"07 10, 2013"

I will keep my fond memories and not spoil them by watching this series.",1461542400,"04 25, 2016"

"This movie is my absolute favorite movie ever.  It is hilarious, explosive, epic, It has John Wayne in it, is pretty much appropriate for ages 9+ with barely any swear words and some violence (People getting shot with very little blood, stuff exploding etc.)  and no innuendo or any inappropriate content.  Plus a great story with an all-star cast and based on true events.  Well done, very realistic and stunning, intense at some parts and just overall great.  I am 12 and I am using my mom's account to wright this.  I love this movie!!!!!!",1444953600,"10 16, 2015"
This movie took most of the great songs from the stage play and dumped them.  For a theater lover this is heartbreaking.  What a disappointing story.  If a movie can be faithful to the theater version then this one is a class-A adulterer.  Even the ending was changed and not for the better.  The dubbing for the two leading ladies was also disappointing.  A pretty face is not enough.,1098662400,"10 25, 2004"

"Jackie Chan's First Strike, also known as Police Story 4: First Strike, is probably the weakest of the series thus far. The movie opens with an entertaining James Bond-ish scene in the snow to get you going, but takes it's time before it heats up again. The whole theme of the Police Story movies have changed dramatically.The first two were true Hong Kong action police detective movies, but starting with Supercop, Chan seemed to change the direction of the films, heading more towards a Bond-like movie. In fact the final underwater fight scene in First Strike is definitely an homage to Thunderball, a Sean Connery James Bond movie. Besides that there is really only one more notable action scene in the film, which would be the scene where Jackie visits Annie to tell her he is innocent.Here Chan exhibits that clearly, he is a master of his environment. Jackie uses almost every single prop in each setting to thwart and disarm his attackers. These incredible acrobatic feats are something that over the years has become a staple in Jackie Chan's martial arts style and is something that keeps people coming back to see his movies.",1400198400,"05 16, 2014"

"STEPMOM, to me, is a very touching, moving, and hilarious movie. I didn't laugh out loud, though. I laughed on the inside. The one person I really couldn't stand at times was Anna (Jena Malone). This was because of her attitude and the way she treated Isabel (Julia Roberts) most of the time. One of my favorite quotes of this movie is, ""Anna! You DO NOT run out on your mother!"" I was moved when Jackie (Susan Sarandon) said, ""Oh, sweetie, it's okay to miss me."" I thought everyone in the movie gave a very moving performance. In conclusion, I recommend this movie to anyone who's a fan of Julia Roberts.",996019200,"07 25, 2001"

"I've just added this classic to my DVD library. Although the DVD itself is not that cool (no such special features as commentaries, cast & crew bios, production notes etc...), it deserves as cherished a place in my library as the place ""Roxanne"" settled in my heart. For the two last decades Hollywood had some rising stars in the category of physical comedy (Ben Stiller, Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey, the Wayans brothers...) but none of them has made a movie that got me laugh so hard while capturing my heart so tenderly at the same time as Steve Martin did with ""Roxanne"". Was it because those new actors couldn't work out something creative like ""the 20 nose jokes"", or was it because they just needed better scripts to bolster their talents? I found it amazing that Steve Martin decided to be the screenplay writer himself and somehow managed to convert the concept of a French Renaissance play -- ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" -- to this modern time comedy and turned its tragic conclusion into a happy ending. Apart from the ""nose jokes"", he gave us so many fun lines to enjoy and remember. And apart from Martin, all other actors also gave their best performances, and best lines too: Shelley Duvall's simple riddle, Daryl Hannah's ""ironic"" refusal of a coat, Rick Rossovitch's ""extemporaneous"" night and ""pillow fluffing"" request..., and, oh yeah, the ""earn more sessions by sleeving"" line... Well, all I want to say is, hurry up, add this movie to your library so your family and friends could share your joy. We all need this kind of joy in a world where ""all the concepts of beauty have been programmed by TV's and magazines"" -- to quote Tony Robbins from ""Shallow Hal"". Now that being said, please bear with one more humble opinion of mine: After ""Roxanne"", I only found ""Shallow Hal"" as a good one in the genre. Hope it won't be the last.",1027728000,"07 27, 2002"

"A good cast could not makeup for a bad storyline and uneven flow. It looks like silly jokes were edited together to form scenes, and in term they made a storyline. Not nearly as good as the first one, where the jokes were a well integrated part of the storyline.",1245801600,"06 24, 2009"

"If you want to see some pretty fun car and motorcycle stunts and some other pretty good special effects, this movie is fine. The plot is fairly easily followed and very predictable, but the ending does have an interesting surprise -- the way Cruise gets out of trouble.

The film was very well acted and visually stunning (as are most Gilliam films). But overall i felt like it was just TOO creepy. Couldn't really handle some of the stuff that went down and for that reason i will probably never watch it again.

"The movie has problems with continuity, it goes from fast to slow in weird pacing jumps. The story is weak at best tho there are a few good parts. John Goodman is almost completely wasted in his role, Denzel's part wasn't much better.  The acting is great in spite of the directing, and there are a few good scenes written in to the story but overall it's just not very satisfying. The ending was juvenile. Hah! If you want a better action flick watch Barbarella again!",1359849600,"02 3, 2013"

The only interesting parts were the sword fights viewed from a distance.  Don't waste your time on it.",1507248000,"10 6, 2017"

"The first episode was in color.  The next episodes were in black and white.  The sound went up and down throughout each episode.  I think it was episode 21 or 22 which was repeated and the ensuing episode wasn't on the disc.  I wrote the BBC to ask about getting a replacement disc with the missing episode and never got a response.Whoever did the quality control for this DVD set should be required to give us all refunds or at the very least prevented from ever producing DVDs again.I bought this series as a gift and it made it look like I bought some slightly irregular box set on clearance, instead of getting a quality set like I assumed I was gifting, which was highly embarassing.  So if you're buying it for someone else, keep it in mind that they're going to be disappointed.You'll still get to see most of the episodes, but expect that you'll be adjusting the volume throughout your viewing and don't count on watching the episodes in color, as they originally aired.  At least it's a period piece, so you can tell yourself that's why it's in black and white.",1254096000,"09 28, 2009"

"That's the line Captain Nathan Brittles (John Wayne) keeps repeating at different junctures throughout this John Ford classic of a retiring cavalry officer and the last mission he must preside over.But although Brittles may not hold with apologizing, we see that his life has had many ups and downs, and will have more before this mission is complete. He and his men must escort his commander's wife and her niece to catch the stage back east, a task made dangerous because of the recent massacre of Custer at the Little Big Horn. There are two storylines at work here: a love triangle of the niece who's playing off two young soldiers against each other, and Brittles' more engrossing story as the old officer tries to carry out this last mission in a world where young blood continually stirs up trouble on the warpath--literally.Wayne does one of his best jobs here, playing a man much older than his actual age. One wonders what he might have done differently had ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" come later in his career, in the 1960s or early 70s. Nevertheless, even though the picture was 25 years ahead of schedule for Wayne, he does a convincing portrayal of the timeworn captain who understands that there is little of glory in the calvary, but much honor if you do your duty. Frequent co-star Victor McLaglin is on hand again, this time as Sgt. Quincannon, also due for retirement in the next few days. This is one of those ""stage Irish"" performances, more than slightly over the top, replete with whiskey drinking and brawling, but not troublesome for all that.Ford rarely handles women convincingly, and Joanne Dru is no exception. She looks more like a 1940s WAC than a 19th century girl visiting the still-untamed West, but Harry Carey Jr and John Agar aren't much help either. Of the younger crowd, the best job is turned in by Ben Johnson, that master horseman who populated not a few of the Ford calvary pictures. He playes Sgt. Tyree, a former Confederate captain who now is an enlisted man in the calvary. This speaks to the uneasy attempt to meld together two armies lately at war with each other, who now must unite to bring the west and the Indians down under US government authority.There are three major factors that make ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" a standout:One is John Wayne's performance. The second is the Nathan Brittles storyline. The third?Absolutely breathtaking cinematography. One knows that this picture's Best Cinematography Oscar was won by just one scene--that amazing storm gathering cloud threatening down on the the calvary as they march through Monument Valley. There are other good shots, but that's the Award-winner, no doubt about that.For those who think that all westerns are the same, make it your business to watch ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" to correct that misconception--and no apologies, please; it's a sign of weakness.",1022716800,"05 30, 2002"

I especially love when the priest's right-hand man gets a new religion and starts chewing the scenery. The best way to approach this one is with friends and to MST3K the thing.

"""Death doesn't like to be cheated."" When a group of employees on a work retreat head out on a bus one of the employees has a vision of a bridge collapse. When he tells everyone to get off only a few listen. All but eight die and the standard ""Final Destination"" plot takes over. This one did have a little different twist in it, but not enough to make it feel original again. If you are a fan of the series you will probably like this one. I have seen them all, and after the second one the only real exciting part for me was watching the way they kill people off. It may just be me, but after the ""Final Destination"", ""Saw"" and ""Scream"" series' it seems like all the cool ideas have been taken. There is really not much to say about this one that hasn't already been done. Un-original ideas, un-original deaths, un-original dialog...but from the fifth movie in a series this isn't a surprise and can't be held against it. On the other hand, if you can't think of any more ideas that you haven't seen before then don't make a new installment. The one great spot in the movie is the way that it ends...watch it and you will see what I mean. Overall, if you like the other four you will most likely like this one too. Just don't expect anything new. I give it a C.Would I watch again? - I don't think so. Not really a series you can watch over and over.*Also try - Final Destination 1-4",1318118400,"10 9, 2011"

I liked the trailer a bit more than the film itself. It was very ambitious and some of the cinematography is really good. But the film over didn't quite grab me as a great movie. The scary parts are not scary and the movie really is over the top but it is a horror film. Some of the visuals are nice so for that it may be worth the view.,1378425600,"09 6, 2013"

Someone breaks into a high-security biological warfare lab, steals a new virus, & just for the fun of it, as he leaves, he tosses a vial of the stuff against the wall, breaking it; then he tries to get away.Fearing contamination, the high-tech super-computer that runs the lab's security decides to kill everyone in the complex! Not only that, it offs a few people in interesting ways; but you're left wondering - what for? Surely such a complex would be able to isolate the affected area? Why'd everyone have to die?Next, a specialist security unit has to get in to discover what happened. What they discover is row after row of coffin like containers, each housing one of the now dead staff members. And, of course, they're all brain-hungry zombies just waiting to get let out!This film is garbage. Sure, there's some well secquenced fight scenes, & they way the computer tries offing the specialist secutirty unit is also interesting.

"""The Deep End of the Ocean"" is one of the best movies of 1999, complex and moving, with truly emotional characters played by actors who carry the weight of the story on their shoulders with incredible ease and make it heartwarming and believable. The movie is actually two different stories, one being a family's emotional coming-to-terms with a missing child, and then the pain and stress they must endure when he shows up nine years later.On her way to her high school reunion, Beth Cappadora is told by her husband that if her head wasn't attached to her, she would lose it quickly. This provides a short laugh, while also setting up what is to come. At the reunion, she leaves her three-year-old son Ben in the care of his older brother Vincent, only to come back moments later and realize that he is gone. Hysterics grow, and after a thorough search of the building, he is nowhere to be found. Surrounded by family and friends, Beth begins to cope with her mistake as the community gets involved in the search for Ben, without success. Resigned to the fact that he will never be found, she returns home, and while the first steps to coping with what has happened are rocky, the family seems to be getting along well after the passage of nine years. They have moved to a new house in a new town, her husband has the restaurant he always wanted... A knock on the door turns everything upside down. Beth immediately recognizes the boy as her son, and is relieved and confused that he lives only two blocks away from their new residence. The authorities get involved, and soon Ben is taken from the only home he can remember and placed in a new and somewhat emotionally frightening setting where he is called by a name he does not know and lives with people he does not remember or feel much for.What makes this movie work for me is the complexity of the story as well as the characters, and the magnificence in which the two blend together. The first part of the story admittedly is the more believable of the two, diving into the emotions of the family as they must cope with the grief of the missing Ben. Beth's reaction to her son's disappearance is superbly acted out by Michelle Pheiffer, who carries it like she's been through it in reality. The first half of the movie shows her dealing with the pain in the only way she knows how: shutting everyone else out, ignoring the optimism of life that is to be explored. This causes her to become somewhat distanced from her husband, played by Treat Williams, and her oldest son, who feels the great weight of responsibility set in when he must take care of his little sister while his parents argue.The second half of the movie is the more emotional of the two, however, as the family, who is just beginning to enjoy life, find their son and bring him back home. There is an unmistakable truth in what occurs emotionally between the two brothers, Vincent and Ben, who goes by Sam. Vincent, who has just begun to gain the attention he never got from his parents, feels threatened by the presence of Ben, and does everything he can to make his long-lost sibling feel unwelcome. This, accompanied by the emotional baggage toted by the family in their struggle to be happy together all conspire to make the movie more heartfelt, warming and true.Some of the best acting talent ever has gone into the making of this movie, which is heavily called for considering the amount of emotion that needs to be conveyed to the audience. Michelle Pheiffer is Beth Cappadora, and in this role, she is literally required to become her character. She does this with superb talent, playing Beth as an overall emotional person with a strong will hidden beneath her sorrows. Treat Williams makes the perfect supportive husband, as well as a father who just wants things to be like he always imagined for his family. Ben's return has a big effect on him, and when he puts his foot down about what the family does together, the acting is nothing short of amazing. Jackson does a great job in playing the older brother Vincent, as well as the wild-child teenager who gets into a lot of trouble. Whoopi Goldberg seems like a stretch as the detective working the case, but she works the camera as well with her serious demeanor.Complexity and integrity are what make a movie worth watching, and ""The Deep End of the Ocean"" has all of this and more. The fact that the plot is basically two parts should not be a deference from the film; believe me, the story rolls right along. Dynamic performances and highly likeable characters also add to the film's appeal. What more can you ask for?",980294400,"01 24, 2001"

"So many reviews bash this film for being a sob-fest, but life is not all peaches and cream, and the reality of divorce, bitter ex-spouses, new relationships, children going through adolescence, and family illness, is very real to a majority of people.  When watching this film, I will agree that many, if not most, of the plot is totally predictable.  You might see things coming from early on.  But this doesn't steal from the fact that Julia and Susan are wonderful actresses, with a wealth of facial expressions and sublties that make them all the more captivating to watch.  Ed Harris doesn't do much more than stand around here, unfortunately.  He has one moving scene, where the emotion seems real, but the tears are fake, yet we still root for him as the dad and ex-husband caught in the middle.  You can really see him act in The Truman Show and The Hours, where he steps up to the plate to deliver extraordinary performances.  Then of course, Step Mom was directed by Chris Columbus and when I see his name on a film I know I'm going to enjoy it...Harry Potter, Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Nine Months, and the list goes on.  I wouldn't choose this 5 tissue film over, let's say, Terms of Endearment, or Beaches, but for me it wins in the category of Real Life Situations played with true talent by well known popular actors.",1128816000,"10 9, 2005"

"Taken by many as one of Sam Fuller's masterpieces, THE NAKED KISS is so completely over-the-top that it seems to create a world all its own. Perhaps the most fascinating thing about it is that the film seems to be advertising itself as a form of hyperrealism in its sensational exploitation of prostitution, child molestation, civic corruption, and (above all) capitalism, yet everything it does is so operatic and charged with hallucinatory detail that it might as well be taking place in Narnia and Middle Earth. The bordello in the film's locale, for example, features prostitutes who ply their wares wearing high heels, teddies, and giant satin heart-shaped headpieces; the hospital for handicapped children seems to force all its patients to wear pirate hats around the clock (even to bed!). And there's no explanation offered for even smaller details, such as why the film's heroine (a former hooker trying to walk the straight and narrow) handles all problems large or small by adminstering vicious beatings, or even why she is almost the only character in the entire film who goes by her first name (rather than by her last name, as Griff and Grant do, or by an exotric moniker, as in the case of Bunny, Buff, Marshmallow, and Hatrack). It might be mere camp, given this surrealism and also the lusciously overripe dialogue Fuller provides his characters, but it becomes genuinely elevated to a much higher level by the artistry of Fuller's sensational direction, particularly in the phenomenal opening scenes involving the (temporarily balded!) heroine beating her pimp and her pick-up by the town's corrupt cop; by the beautiful cinematography of Stanley Cortez; and by the very sincere and thoughtful performance in the lead role of Constance Towers, who is rather like a more expressive Tippi Hedren and who gets to display her beautiful singing voice in yet another of the film's bizarre and inexplicable plot turns.",1149811200,"06 9, 2006"

I was unaware that it had to say complete on it in order for it to be complete. Why offer it, unless you say that is not complete. Again why would you buy it if it wasn't complete.

"Touted as supernatural thriller / film noir, FALLEN hasn't dated well at all.  The truth is: the show while beautifully filmed, is too tame and slow to generate any real thrills.  The average viewer would get more suspense out of watching an episode of CSI.  The film fails primarily because it tries to incorporate too many genres and falls short in each.The only reason to watch this movie of course is Denzel Washington - who's never had a bad performance.  The able cast around him - Donald Sutherland, John Goodman, James Gandolfini et al - don't do much either.  The film is ultimately very PG in treatment, which works against it.

"Pal Joey is thoroughly delightful.  I'd forgotten just how much.  Even though my favorite song comes from this movie, Frank Sinatra was much too old and didn't have Eddie Fisher's looks for an EF fanclub president like little old me.  I certainly thought he was taller (like Michael Feinstein, big talent comes in short people); after all, he was already a star in the entertainment business and movies, not just on television.  Though he was not 'bewitching,' he was a bundle of talent and versitility with lots of media attention and some gorgeous ex-wives.To think that Hitch's blonde in ""Vertigo"" had music in her veins, Kim Novack was a good foil for Sinatra's antics on and off stage.  But it took Rita Hayworth to put him in his place.  She was the star from Knob Hill.Watch and see how good the musicals were fifty years ago and see Sinatra at his best.  Thanks to Carlos (not Mark), it was later that I learned to appreciate Frank's perfect enunciation as I aided in his quest for perfect English.  No one since has come close to him with the exception of Feinstein, who so graciously sang 'But Not for Me,' a Gershwin song, to me in Nashville.  What a night!",1225843200,"11 5, 2008"

"This would have been a very good version of Jane Eyre except for the terrible miscasting of Mr. Rochester. Mr. Hinds simply isn't a romantic lead in any way, shape or form and his Rochester is nowhere near adequate. Its so distracting that I just couldn't believe the relationship between them. Jane wasn't plain enough for the role. Excellent actress though. The role of Jane calls for an actress that can look really drab most of the time then glow with animation at other times which changes her whole face.",1314835200,"09 1, 2011"
"I don't know if the movie is any good, as I wasn't able to watch it. Or, to be precise, to hear it. The movie soundtrack is DTS only, while Dolby Digital is used for the commentaries only (in Korean, with no subtitles). This should be warned in the product description.",1222387200,"09 26, 2008"
"It seems that Luc Besson is capable of reaching deep inside of this Milla Jojovich and bringing out a beautiful monster.  Her portrayal of one of the least understood of our most famous icons is intense, and thoughtful - bringing the viewer full circle around the character of Joan of Arc.Unfortunately, Jojovich is the the only relief from what is a long and generously violent flick.  There are a number of ""spirtual"" moments in the film which deal with her supposed communication with God.  However, it is apparent that Besson has his predetermined notions as to whether Joan of Arc was indeed divine or disturbed and we are never really given the opportunity to consider the other.Unfortunately for Besson, this is the first movie to involve knights, castles, and battles since Braveheart(Gibson, 1995) which seems to have become the obvious comparison.  Even the ""revenge"" story is not dissimilar enough from the Braveheart ""righteous revenge"" theme to encourage excitement about The Messenger.Even an ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"" style performance from Dustin Hoffman does not detract from the fact that by the time you have sat through The Messenger, you will really feel that you have seen it all before.",970531200,"10 3, 2000"
Really bad movie,1453075200,"01 18, 2016"

"I never saw this movie prior to watching it in this version, but I have to say that this was an amazing movie! I loved the fact that the movie looked at both the  American and Japanese versions of the war. Of other movies that I have seen about the war this was definitely one of the most intriguing, eye-opening film that made me truly consider both sides of the war. As a lover of history this movie was amazing. If you love history and considering different points of view, this is an amazing movie that you do not want to miss. I also loved some of the special features on the blu-ray, especially the 10 extra minutes you can get on this film... it was amazing!",1323129600,"12 6, 2011"

"Here's the problem. The filmmaker - one Paul Anderson - discards the whole survival horror premise in exchange for a straight action shoot-em-up film. The result - the fun of the game is lost. The film is at its best when the characters come up against hordes of zombies - including a really cool homage to both Day and Dawn of the dead involving intestines. But there is absoloutely no wit to the film - it wants to take itself too seriously. And that is the biggest problem. This film should have been fun, campy, and have absoloutely no regard for itself as a serious film. Instead, it tries to scare with the subtlety of a smack on the back of the head - and fails.",1028592000,"08 6, 2002"
"BEWARE who ever decided this was PG 13 was totally out of touch and possibly crazy. The violence in the first few mins of the movie,a violent unexpected explosion killing innocent little girls is horrifying and shocking.

"I gave this 2 stars because I think Dominique Swan is right on - she was the most wonderful Lolita ever - and because as a gal who loves her rock n' rollers I thought this was going to be the greatest movie ever.  But, it failed to impress.  I was the Dominique Swan character, running after my favorite rock band because I was hopelessly in love with the lead singer and would stop at nothing for him.  I've had those nights standing out in the rain or arriving at a show that's canceled because I loved that band so much.  And my determination paid off!  *Patting myself on the back*But the subplotting lead me to see this as a silly teen movie.  The lesbian aspect was tripe, but I realize that were I in her (Dominique's) position at her age I wouldn't understand something like that either.  The other characters were shallow, and it wasn't all that swift a story line otherwise.",1124928000,"08 25, 2005"

"Two stars for the effects and the imaginative worlds but other than that, this movie is over the top, sappy and dumb. It has some funny moments but they really try too hard with the dialogue and the acting. Chris Pratt is an obnoxious little boy with too much screen time and the makeup effects are pretty bad. Story needs some work, a few of the characters were fun and interesting with the exception of the cheesy ending. Worth watching ONCE and then never again. Even then, you might want to be doing something else while you watch it, like cleaning the house or something.",1420070400,"01 1, 2015"

"I'm not sure I can recommend this.  There is a lot that is very accomplished about this set. The animation is expertly done, the voices are well performed, the story is interesting, but..., there are some problems. It attempts to be ""frightening"" and ultimately doesn't do very well there. The characters ""try"" to be endearing, but you don't end up caring very much about any of them. And the set ends with a story that makes no clear revelation as to what happened to bring it to an end.  There's a climactic battle between good and evil, and no clear understanding of who won, and never any real answers in the story as to why the things that happen are happening. I did not find the ""monsters"" to be very impressive.  Sort of mundane looking and uninteresting. A lot of blood is shed, but it doesn't seem very realistic. This set of episodes was interesting enough to hold my attention through to the end, but I will not watch it again.

Specifically:The Good -- Apollo 11 landing video was amazing, best I've ever seen. Surface operations video was excellent as well, some I'd never seen. DOES benefit from the higher resolution of Blu-Ray in places.The Bad -- WAY too much time and video of astronauts horsing around for the camera in route to the Moon and talking about their feelings and the ""vastness of space"". Like some type of encounter session or something. I want interviews with engineers, talk about mission planning, details on computing systems, science operations carried out on the lunar surface, etc. None of that was provided. Also -- portions of the NASA video had some sort of grainy, ""artsy"" effect added to it that served no purpose whatsoever and ruined those segments for me.Interesting video overall and somewhat worth the purchase but I wish I had looked around more.",1249257600,"08 3, 2009"

"The Fisher King is a representational movie. It makes use of Arthurian legend, and parallels the legend of the Fisher King with the lives of the two main protagonists - Parry (Robin Williams) and Jack (Jeff Bridges). Symbolism and metaphorical techniques are utilisied extensively throughout the film, which makes it an extremely visual experience to watch. However, the symbolism extends beyond the visual plane, to a very psychological one. For example, Parry's creation of a fantastical world full of 'little fat people' and the 'Red Knight', is very much representative of his own mental condition; the fantasy world, minus the Red Knight, represents Parry's acceptance/ignorance of his mental trauma. At the same time the Red Knight is symbolic of the pain and suffering as caused by the trauma itself.Whenever Parry shows glimpes of sanity (lucid speech, dating, feeling love again, etc.), the Red Knight always appears in his life. While the Red Knight is at bay Parry is not catatonic or overwrought by his trauma. To overcome/accept the trauma of seeing his wife murdered before his eyes, ultimately Parry has to confront the Red Knight and vanguish him. However, he lacks the insight and strength to do this on his own. Enter Jack - who ultimately feels responsible for Parry's condition! Jack is the equivalent of the fool or simpleton from the story of the Fisher King. Jack's intent is one of redemption, while he is absorbed into Parry's world. Eventually Jack begins to understand Parry's need for the Holy Grail, which represents Acceptance of Loss. If Parry is able to possess the Holy Grail, then he shall be able to vanguish Insanity as represented by the Red Knight.While there are elements of fantasy and Arthurian legend woven into this story, there is also a theme of Christianity. Originally Jack is driven by a need to regain the former glory of his life when he was a successful talkback radio host. He wants that life back and believes that by helping Parry, he will overcome his guilt, and thus be able to resume his former life. Jack feels a false resolution in his life when he regains his former life. However, ultimately, when Jack agrees to undertake the quest for the Holy Grail, only then do his motives become self-less. He helps Parry because he wants to, not because he needs to drive away his own guilt - this is very much part of the Christian Doctrine.On the whole, The Fisher King is an intricate weaving of comedy, drama and tragedy. The direction by Gilliam is faultless, his attention to detail evident especially in the Chinese Restaurant scene, where he borrows from Chinese film-making techniques, using the vertical black bar wipe technique.This is the type of movie which, on a superficial level, is only somewhat satisfying. However, it is on the psychological level where its real impact is felt - tragic, hopeful and uplifting. It is not the type of movie to watch if you are expecting to be entertained!",999043200,"08 29, 2001"

"At least, that's what he has implied by ruining both Resident Evil and Aliens vs. Preditor. Why oh why did Sony choose him over George Romero? He had a script ready to go, and then Anderson walked in and offered to do it for less money, and that was that. The same thing can be said about Aliens vs. Preditor. Dream projects like AVP and RE will never be safe so long as Paul Anderson is making movies.If you want the real Resident Evil expirience, I suggest you play the remake of the first game on Gamecube. If you desire a non-interactive adaptation of the games, read the books. If you must see just how badly Anderson botched up the RE mythology, then by all means see the movies. But be forwarned, they suck. What could have been an excellent horror film adaptation of a classic game turned into a C grade action movie flop.",1094947200,"09 12, 2004"

"the star wars movies are just awesome. I like them better than any other film trilogy or franchise, they are all very entertaining and action-packed with interesting characters and effects that look more real than anything in, say, the phantom menace. I think both sequels to the original star wars are better. The story and dialogue is a little too hokey in that last movie, although it was a revolution in the way we look at movies. In the sequels the characters are more developed and we also explore more of the star wars universe. Although Empire clearly has the best story, Jedi might be the most entertaining and definitely the most satisfying in the series. Kids usually like this one the best, because it is very funny and has a very happy ending.",973728000,"11 9, 2000"

"I was pretty worried going into Nothing In Common earlier tonight.  I seem to be a VERY picky person when it comes to Tom Hank films.  Besides Forest Gump, I mostly only like his ultra serious films, such as Saving Private Ryan and a few others that escape my mind at the moment.I still believe Tom Hanks hit the high point in his career around 10 years ago.  He didn't exactly start out as an incredible movie star.  It took him a long time to get going and win over movie watchers.However, Nothing In Common turned out to be good.  Not GREAT by any stretch of the imagination- just barely good enough that I recommend sticking through the first hour of useless storytelling in order to get to the good stuff (the good being Tom Hanks' characters relationship with his father).The first hour of Nothing In Comming features nothing but Hanks' character trying to sleep with a few different women, and he ends up succeeding.  I guess these moments are supposed to qualify as humor, or romantic-style humor, but for me it doesn't exactly work because there's no interesting storyline development while this is going on.  Some of the other characters he communicates with is rather unexceptional and pointless to include in the story as well.  Makes me wonder what movie writers were thinking back then.The film is also SEVERELY dated.  It's definitely stuck in the mid 80's, right down to the ugly predictable pacing and the wimpy music that's supposed to pass the test as ""beautiful"" and ""fitting the mood"".  Prepare yourself for a huge smack of the 80's right in your face as far as the soundtrack and presentation is concerned.At least the relationship between Tom Hanks' character and his father actually got good starting around the halfway point, otherwise this would have easily been a 1-star forgettable (and laughable) movie for Tom Hanks.  He moved on to *much* better things later on.",1269993600,"03 31, 2010"

"If you haven't seen the original and just want to watch an American remake, this is the one for you, plus it has the bonus of featuring one of America's finest actresses, one often underused or ill utilized by directors who don't know what to make of her sterling talent.  I'm not talking about Sarah (BUFFY) Michelle Gellar, not this time, but instead I speak today of Grace Zabriskie, the actress who plays the elderly woman who sleeps on the floor and seems so haunted by the violent deaths of everyone she knows.Grace Zabriskie has one of those faces you've seen over and over again, often playing disturbed or Satanic mothers along the lines of Angela Lansbury's character in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.  Her other forte is playing supportive, rather helpless and pathetic mothers who are nevertheless sweet and loving.  I first became aware of Ms. Zabriskie's sweeping talent while watching the US soap opera of the 1980s, SANTA BARBARA.  She took a nothing part and filled it with every kind of theatrical, filmic gesture, elevating an ordinary show into the kind of thing you would tape every day just on the off chance that she would make an appearance on it.  (That's actually not fair to SB which in many ways was one of the most innovative shows on TV.)  Then my friends who knew I liked Grace Zabriskie would call me and tell me they had spotted her in other shows and films.  She played one of the hardened factory hands in NORMA RAE and she excelled in DRUGSTORE COWBOY.  She was the mother of Laura Palmer in the series of TWIN PEAKS, and she was Debra Winge's mother in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN.  Need I say more?  For twenty-five years she has been giving us her all, and in THE GRUDGE she gives no quarter to the general shoddiness of the production.  She attacks the part as though she were playing Gertrude in HAMLET (which she is in a way).  Watch her as she turns white, and her struggles for breath, and her anguished pleas to Sarah Michelle Gellar, the co-star with whom she seems to have the most empathy.  If they had an entry for GREATNESS in the dictionary, there would be a little picture of Grace Zabriskie to illustrate the noun.By the way, she is a talented writer too, much more talented than the screenwriters of most of the movies, and she's made almost 100!",1114387200,"04 25, 2005"

"I've read the various comments to the effect that the complete series is a good value at $80, and that SHOUT FACTORY should not be held accountable for  the actions of FOX.1. SHOUT FACTORY was more than well aware of the history of the series release. Why did they choose to release the entire series rather than seasons 5 and 6? Would they have us believe they felt the majority of individuals inclined to purchase the Bob Newhart sat out the first 4 seasons in the hope that SHOUT FACTORY would come along and release the entire series at a great price? They new quite well that fans already owned the first 4 seasons, and bet that they would pay a hefty price to get the remaining two. Their offer to release seasons 5 and 6 now, after numerous complaints, is a bit lame.2.$80 is a great price for the series if you don't already own the individual seasons, but where is this market? Most fans who are inclined to by DVD'S of the series at all, have already bought one or more seasons. Individuals who are not familiar with the show and would like to ""try it out"", may buy one or two seasons to see if they like it. I doubt they would spring for the entire series.3. Fans are being unfairly faulted for ""jumping the gun"" , and purchasing the first 4 seasons as they were offered. We believed that the studio would act in good faith , and , in time, release all 6 seasons. They didn't.

"First of all let me just say that this movie has the worst anticlimatical ending of all time: there's no verbal or telepathic communications established with the aliens, no sense of what their intentions are, no reason mentioned for why they've abducted people, no reason to explain why Richard Dreyfuss' character is the ""chosen one"", and worst of all we (the audience) are left to believe that a stupid little hand gesture means that everything is all hunky-dory with the aliens- case closed, everything is all right with the aliens because Steven Spielberg says so. Don't worry about cattle mutilations or any of those other violent abductions you've been hearing about, everything's all fine and dandy.The first half of the movie was good, but for some reason they decided to turn it into some watered-down, cheesy, leave-the-audience-feeling-secure kind of movie during the last half. Another reviewer mentioned the movie 2001 and compared it to Close Encounters, all I have to say is that they're completely different from each other- one has a philosophical message and one doesn't. Basically this movie is for those who wanna lie to themselves and say that there's nothing to worry about. 2001 is definitely the movie to see if your interested in aliens- im not saying it's real (who knows though?), but its sure more engaging than Close Encounters.",972259200,"10 23, 2000"
"The film  ""Close Encounters"" is one of the best Spielberg ever directed,some would argue THE best and I would be hard pressed to counter that assertion.This is indeed a wonderful movie ,a film that works on multiple levels and on a grand scale that focuses on the people that have encountered UFOs up close and personal. Spielberg even gave the late Prof. Allen Hynek famed UFO researcher from North Western University a cameo role near the end of the picture to lend it an even more realistic touch.However Spielberg has stated more than once that he would NEVER release the movie as it was originally shown and true to his word he has so far stubbornly carried out his promise. His reasoning on this point totally baffles this reviewer. It IS a wonderful film,what is the problem Mr. Spielberg?Therefore if you  would like to see an uncut/original version of this film,NOTHNG at ths time of writing is available to satisfy your desire. Nor does it look promising for the forseeable future. What a pity.

"Hey I saw this movie for the first time ever in the theaters when I was 7 years old, and this movie scared the heck out of me (to put it nicely).  I hated this movie between that and when it hit cable, then I increasingly got not-scared of it.  I just recently purchased this DVD and watched it for the first time in 12 years and to be honest, when you take the spooky and gross out stuff out of it, it's a heartwarming movie.  Plus for me it reminds me of life growing up in the early 80s, since both young kids (Carol Anne and Robbie) are around what my age was then. Based on first hand experience, please do not show this movie to your kid if he's that young.  I went after begging my mom to take me there. LOL Robbie (Oliver Robbins) is a boy who has possibly two of any 8-year-old kid's worst nightmares come true; a tree (or any object that looks mean) coming to life to take him away, and a clown who comes to life to attack him. Carol-Anne (the late Heather O'Rourke) ends up in another void, and her mom finally goes in to get her, to put it simply. There's everything for you in this movie, and if you're old enough, it won't scare you THAT much.",987379200,"04 16, 2001"

"This is one of the great films of the second half of the twentieth century. It is, in essence, Pygmalion redux. Unlike GB Shaw's treatment, however, Michael Caine's Eng Lit professor is the sort of dissolute character of whom Henry Higgins would most certainly have disapproved. In the middle of an extended alcohol-soaked mid-life crisis, Dr Bryant is content to drift along on an ocean of self-pity and self-contempt. His original conception of himself as a poet fell apart when he realized he had no real talent. Now he lives out his life as a university lecturer in a parody of middle-class contentment.Into this life walks Rita. For viewers unfamiliar with England, and particularly of England before the Thatcher revolution permeated downward to undo centuries of rigid class system assumptions and automatic prejudices, it's important to understand that Rita's working-class (blue collar) life would never have come into contact with Bryant's middle-class existence except perhaps to serve him in a corner shop or clean his rooms for a pittance. Rita, however, is that rare thing: a person of above-average intelligence and drive, seeking a way out of the claustrophobic half-life she shares with her uneducated husband. Rita wants to better herself. She wants an education. And when Bryant demurres, she forces herself upon him.The core of the movie is Rita's acquisition not only of knowledge but of middle-class moeurs counterpointed by Bryant's ever-greater dissolution. Watching Rita wrap herself in the most cliched middle-class affectations, Bryant feels he's been party to helping her rob herself of her authenticity. At the same time it is also clear that as she becomes more accomplished his role in her life is reduced, and he resents this. The result is a scene in which a drunken Bryant scorns Rita for what she's become and she asserts her need to be more than she was.It may not be immediately apparent to non-British viewers just how dead-end life could feel in the UK prior to the Thatcher years. Britain was a place of strikes, of decay, of dashed hopes and dreary days. It was a place where few could feel optimistic about the future. As Bryant says towards the end of the movie, Britain back then was ""a place that's just finishing."" The power of this movie comes from Rita's determination not to sink without trace, without fighting.In the end both are redeemed. Bryant hits rock-bottom and is sent off to Australia (""It's a paradise for the likes of me"") and Rita gets her degree despite having received a very object lesson in the thinness of the middle-class veneer she assumed was somehow more substantial than her working-class background. As she tells Bryant, ""I had the choice."" And having gained her degree a world of choices opens up to her.This is very satisfying movie because it works across all levels. The acting is first-rate, the dialog is both witty but also believable, and the final resolution is optimistic without being trite. All in all, this is a movie to see and enjoy and perhaps see again for its warmth and humanity.",1475452800,"10 3, 2016"

"The sequel to 'Resident Evil' has more actions, to be sure, but the film itself is done with less creativity and originality, repeating what you have seen in other better films featuring the un-deads, or zombies.  (The timing of the release is worst for we have seen recently 'Dawn of the Dead.')  And as to the actions, some must be really good -- I say 'must' because many scenes are poorly directed and edited, with a camerawork that shows the director doens't know how to create exciting fighting sequences, whether they are martial arts or bullet shootings.Sorry if I sound harsh, but don't say I am missing the point.  I know the film is based on a Capcom game, and I know the story is only an excuse for the heroine Alice (Milla Jovovich who returned from the original) who must fight against a lots of zombies, in Racoon City which always looks like Toronto.  I'm not complaining about it.Anyway, the Umbrella Corp. very strong company cause the infection of deadly virus that spread all over the city (which has only one bridge to access there), and it should be contained immediately.  Many citizens are turned zombies, who attack the following hapless people -- Beside Alice, tough (suspended) cop Jill (Sienna Guillory, 'Love Actually'), soldier Carlos (Oded Fehr 'The Mummy'), small-time crook LJ (Mike Epps, 'Friday'), newsreporter Terri (Sandrine Holt).  Plus you see Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) and Major Cain (Thomas Kretschmann, 'The Pianist') who controls the military operation ruthlessly.If you can ignore the numerous plot holes and inconsistent logics, 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' has serious problems with it.  As I said, the fighting sections, which should be the biggest feature of the film, suffer heavily from the inept editing that use too many fast cuts and slanted camera.  Milla Jovovich, physically fit, is fine as the fighting heroine, but the camera fails to capture the essence of her, which was so eloquently shown in 'The Fifth Element.'To make matters worse, though Milla is as beautiful as ever, the film's confusing (and unfocused) plot somehow refuses to use her to the full.  In fact, you don't see Alice on screen for considerable time, as the film heavy-handedly introduces other characters into the story.  And the way it does is so confusing that you find the film repetitive -- see how many times you have to see some people biting others, which causes inevitable results.  Many have already seen the consequence in the original, so once is fine.  Twice is unnecessary.There are good things, though.  Sienna Guillory is a standout as the strong-willed police officer, whose acting is perhaps better than the star Milla Jovovich.  Perhaps her roles was cut short (especially the earlier part) because some of her behaviors in the opening parts look too adrupt.  They should not have done that (if they did, I mean).  And Mike Epps gives us a few moments of genuine laughs, which are always welcome to me.But as a whole 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is a bit disappointment, because of its recycled ideas and mediocre actions.  What if Paul W.S. Anderson (who wrote the script, but went to direct 'Alien vs Predator') directed this?  I don't know, but perhaps, just perhaps, made it more effective than Alexander Witt, who was the second director for pefectly choleographed 'Pirates of the Carribians.'",1094774400,"09 10, 2004"

"Hollywood's latest contestant in the video-game-cum-feature-film sweepstakes rears its head in the form of Screen Gems Resident Evil.  Originally Evil was in the hands of zombie guru George A. Romero but ultimately it was not to be, and his latest foray into the zombie arena was momentarily halted.  Currently Romero is in pre-production on the 4th installment of his popular `Dead' series. That aside Resident Evil liberally culls its plot and look from the popular PlayStation discs, classic zombie flicks and Alien-type sci-fi.  But alas Anderson's Evil disappointingly brings very little to the horror fans table.Is the film all bad? Well, no. On the contrary, the cybernetic sets are slick and well conceived, as are the gored-up, out of control zombie dogs. The script is a notch above par and the soundtrack features music by Crystal Method, Static X, Slipknot and Marilyn Manson. However strong these attributes are they hardly rescue this release from being more run of the mill, teenage drekk.Fans of Lucio Fulci and/or George Romero's zombie epics will find little redeeming in this sanitary picture. It's appalling that Hollywood can screw up such a simple formula. There's no need for convoluted plots or deep subtext. Merely start with some dead bodies and a gung-ho group of survivalists fused with radiation or good old-fashioned voodoo and you've got yerself the makins' for a zombie marathon. Oh, and you can't forget the blood, lots of blood.Resident Evil was rated R for ""Strong Sci-Fi / Horror Violence, Language, Brief Sexuality / Nudity."" Taking the latter first, there was only one fleeting glimpse of a female nipple and some sex-under-the-sheets-in-a-flashback-with-a-strobe-light type of crap. Next up is ""Language."" I recall but one ""F"" word and I'm quite sure that many a youngster has spewed-forth much worse while blasting the contaminated undead in the comforts of their parents' homes. Finally the ""Strong Violence"" - the handling of this aspect distressed me as I soon found that these zombies hardly bled at all. Yep, a near blood-free zombie pic. In the film's defense they did attempt to explain this by saying, ""the blood coagulates only after the body is dead."" Fine. So now we should see blood clots and splats rather than streams and pools, but we don't. What we see is a whole lot of nothing.Furthermore, the fast action scenes (i.e. minions of zombies being massacred by 3 people) are obscenely influenced by the stylistic renderings of the MTV age. Any gore that may have been present in these sequences is completely blanketed in an overkill of rapid-fire filmmaking tricks and stunts. So while it may come as a surprise to all 4 (count `em!) of the producers, the jittery camera pans, quick editing, flickering lights and extreme close-ups just make for one unpleasant mess.It's a sad fact that the video game is more compelling, more fun and a helluva lot bloodier than its cinematic offshoot.Note: The film's star Milla Jovovich may have experienced some dj vu as she awakens towards the end near naked on a lab table, just as she was at the start of The Fifth Element. Bruce Willis co-starred in The Fifth Element and awoke to a similar predicament in Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys. All roads seem to lead back to Bruce Willis. I don't like that.By: Christopher Curry",1096761600,"10 3, 2004"

"Two years have passed since Julie James was tortured by her fish-hook wielding nemesis, a victim of her friends' hit and run.  However, the body was never found.  Still living in fear, and in college, Julie is delighted when she and her friends win a holiday to the Bahamas in a radio competition.Although I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is meant to be a revenge sequel- it seems to focus more on advertising on a holiday in the Bahamas.  By the end of the film, we are sick and tired of Julie's moaning and just want to see her get slashed and gashed!  Yet again, the film ends with sequel potential.Question is- can we handle another Summer sequel?

"A year after Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", in 1993, he followed up with the summer action film ""Last Action Hero"".The film was directed by John McTiernan (""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"", ""The 13th Warrior"", ""The Thomas Crown Affair"") and a screenplay by Shane Black (""Lethal Weapon"" films, ""The Monster Squad"", ""The Last Boy Scout"") and David Arnot (""The Adventures of Ford Fairlane"").  The film featured cinematography by Dean Semler (""Bruce Almighty"", ""The Alamo"", ""The Longest Yard"", ""2012') and music by Michael Kamen (""X-Men"", ""Band of Brothers"", ""Frequency)"".An expensive film which cost around $85 million, the film was literally a spoof on action films and would feature cameos from many stars around that time.  From Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ian McKellen, Tina Turner, Robert Patrick and many more.The film revolves around a boy named Danny Madigan (played by Austin O'Brien) who is a big fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger action films, especially his character Jack Slater.The problem with Danny is that he rarely goes to school and it's become a problem since he spends his time watching movies and his mother covers up for him.With the release of ""Jack Slater IV"", his friend Nick (played by Robert Prosky) who runs a very old rundown movie theater that is not doing so well, Jack gives him a sneak preview to catch the movie.  Nick also talks about how he was given a gold-ticket by Harry Houdini but never used it.Nick tears the ticket in half and gives Danny the other half and as Danny is getting involved and enjoying the film, the ticket starts to magically work and next thing you know, Danny is inside the film for ""Jack Slater IV"" and in this world, things work like the movies and not real life.As the film progresses and Danny sticks with Jack Slater and the two take on the bad guys which include the evil Englishman Benedict (played by Charles Dance).  But somehow along the way, Benedict steals Danny's ticket and has now cross over to the real world where Danny has come from.In the real world, Benedict starts to learn that bad guys can win and starts killing people and noticing that the police are not there to stop him.  So, Benedict comes up with an idea to stop Jack Slater and that is by killing off the real actor that plays him...Arnold Schwarznegger.Can Jack Slater and Danny stop Benedict in time?VIDEO & AUDIO:""Last Action Hero"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has given this film a pretty good treatment as they have with ""Cliffhanger"" and ""Air Force One"" in which they kept the film as close to what we see on the big screen, including the fine layer of grain.For a film that is 17-years-old, the film looks good for its age and because there is so much happening throughout the film.  For example, in Danny's world, you can see how run down the theater is, old-style seats and everything is dark and there aren't any vibrant colors.  Until he goes into Jack Slater's world, then colors are vibrant and much better visuals.  Definitely a major improvement from the 2003 DVD of ""Last Action Hero"".Now, where this film shines is with its lossless audio soundtrack.  Featured in English, French, Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1, one thing that ""Last Action Hero"" had when it was first released in theaters was the fact it was the first film to utilize Sony's Dynamic Digital Sound.  Granted, at that time, many theaters weren't equipped to play SDDS but there was concentration on the film's audio and that is where this Blu-ray shines.The opening sequence alone shows you that the film is going to utilize all channels and thus bringing a more immersive soundscape as you hear gun shots, explosions, crashing metal, booms all through your front, surround and rear surround channels.  Subwoofer utilizes the booms and for the most part, this is the best I have ever heard from this film.  The lossless audio soundtrack for this 1993 film is very well-done!Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Last Action Hero"" comes with no major special features but is BD-Live enabled with movieIQ which allows people to obtain real-time information of the cast, music, trivia while watching the film.JUDGMENT CALL:When ""Last Action Hero"" first came out and when I watched in the theaters, I figured a pairing with director John McTiernan and Arnold Schwarznegger (known for their action films) would be a wonderful pairing.  But I can remember how impatient I was getting because the film seemed so long (especially at 131 minutes).  I felt that the arc where Danny is in Jack Slater's world tend to drag quite a bit.But I admit that I enjoyed how it was a satire of action films and also featured cameos by many celebrities.  By the third and final arc, things started to get more interesting as Jack Slater is pulled out of his magical world and now having to deal with this new world that he is quite unaware of.  For the most part, ""Last Action Hero"" was a good popcorn flick but I do remember that since it came right after ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", there was high expectations.Needless to say, despite what the critics may have felt about the film, ""Last Action Hero"" did well in the worldwide box office and even some appreciating the film much more now than when it first came out in theaters back in 1993.For those who purchased the 2003 DVD and are big fans of the film, you maybe wondering if the Blu-ray is worth buying.  The bad news is that there are no special features on this Blu-ray unless you have BD-Live and you can take advantage of the movieIQ function.  But other than that, I'm still amazed that for a film that was quite expensive, featured so many talent did not have any featurette created for it.  No commentary, no theatrical trailer, there is no special features and to me, that's surprising.  But the Blu-ray is a major step up in picture and audio quality and that is where fans of the film will appreciate its HD release on Blu-ray.Overall, ""Last Action Hero"" on Blu-ray is literally a barebones Blu-ray release but for Schwarzenegger or McTiernan fans and those who truly enjoyed this film will definitely enjoy it much more with its video and audio upgrade.",1264464000,"01 26, 2010"

"While I had marvelous service from the seller, this did not turn out to be the version I was hoping for. There are known complaints about the heavily edited nature of A Muppet Family Christmas, so I should have done my research better before buying it, but it seems that the all-regions import version is not the same as the UK version which supposedly has the unedited, original show. I made the assumption they were the same and didn't think to contact the seller and ask, so this is purely my own fault.While I am glad to have at least a partial (although confusingly edited) version, and I really did get quick and excellent service as well as a great buy from the seller, I am still in the market for the elusive, full-content version of A Muppet Family Christmas. This particular version (due to copyright law and everyone wanting a piece of the financial pie) was very heavily edited before being sold in the US and many of the best songs (and thereby best scenes) are missing. This leads to non-existent scene transitions, random jumps in the story line, and an overall confusing film. Rather than a classic Muppet film and a nostalgic hearkening back to younger days which you can't wait to share with your family, it ends up as messy Muppet mayhem which fails to live up to memory's expectations.",1412640000,"10 7, 2014"

"Depending on who you are, you will either enjoy this film or think it is rather stupid and insipid.  I happen to fall into the latter category, and  although I do believe there are good movies aimed at that particular  audience (teens) I don't feel this is it..  The writing is underdeveloped,  with a story that is, although has its moments, seems to be trying to hard  to be humourous while still maintaining its horror element - resulting in a  graphic gore element mixed with botched comedy.  This, like HALF BAKED,  seems to support dope smoking, although the interpretation can be that that  is the reason Anton's two friend's end up dead and he has a possessed hand  because he is lazy and is going no where with his life.  Yet this is  nullified when the kids still smoke it at the end, contributing the end to  `good marijuana'  The main character's name I figured was a nod to Anton  LaVey, who is the founder of the modern day Satanic church.  There is no  explanation given why Anton's two friends come back from the dead, other  than they just didn't want to go `toward the light'.  In a scene  reminiscent of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD they come out of the ground,  providing gross humour.  Like the horror genre it is more of a spoof of  than an actual example, there is nudity (two kids decide to fornicate and  are dressed in KISS costumes).All in all, a bad movie that is aimed at  the teen-age genre with pointless drugs and a bad script.  I do like Seth  Green, however.  He is one of the few redeeming factors (that and the  movie's refusal to take itself seriously) in this B flick.",965260800,"08 3, 2000"

"A sincere attempt at a Stephen King type film quickly turns into an Alan King type production. Only the acting skills of Denzel Washington and Donald Sutherland prevent this supposed thriller from  becoming a 3 Stooges affair. Warned not to get involved in a closed murder case, Officer Denzel does just the opposite and mayhem ensues. A demon is unearthed who writes in ancient Aramaic, yet prefers listening to the ""Rolling Stones"" in English. This supernatural creature can occupy only one human at a time,but can jump from one person to another in a split second. As dead bodies start piling up,Denzel decides to become the sacrificial lamb, poisoning himself after seemingly all targets of demon occupation have eliminated one another. Frustrated, the demon finally wins out, occupying a stray cat. The flick ends with a loud rendition of ""Sympathy for the devil"". ""Nineteenth nervous brekdown"" would hav been better.",1196812800,"12 5, 2007"

"It's difficult not to be nostalgic now about The Unbearable Lightness of Being. This was a world in which the Soviet Union was a fact of life for hundreds of millions of people and a particular kind of culture and way of life existed. In a strange way it's initially an optimistic kind of world, and that's appropriate for what is essentially an optimistic view of human nature and love. Other reviewers have covered the jist of the tale so I won't recount it here. Suffice it to say that the young Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent as the sexually magnetic Tomas; equally important is the fact that the cinamatography is outstanding.The movie pivots around departures: first the departure of Tomas and his circle for Geneva after the Prague Spring is crushed by Russian soliders; then the departure from Geneva back to Prague that is precipitated by Teresa's loss of hope regarding her marriage. The sub-plot departure of Sabina presages the main plot departure of Teresa and both are synchronous. It's a truism that women leave, almost heedless of the wreck they cause by their departures, and the story is true to life in this regard. When Tomas follows Teresa back to Prague the movie grows dark and claustrophobic - the CCCP has imposed its iron rule and the color has gone out of the world. Little details like the removal of passports, Tomas' colleagues with their too-ready acceptance of compromises and betrayals... these small notes add layer upon layer of atmosphere, just as the small light notes of the beginning of the movie lent warmth and optimism.For someone viewing this in 2011 - especially if you've been to former Soviet Union countries - it's like stepping back in time to a world lost long ago. It wasn't a good world, but in this vignette it's intense and poignant and makes for an irresistible movie. It's heart-rending and worth every moment. Usually adaptations of books are inferior but in this case I venture the opinion that the movie is a better artistic creation than the book from which it is taken.",1300147200,"03 15, 2011"

Not only that, it offs a few people in interesting ways; but you're left wondering - what for? Surely such a complex would be able to isolate the affected area? Why'd everyone have to die?Next, a specialist security unit has to get in to discover what happened. What they discover is row after row of coffin like containers, each housing one of the now dead staff members. And, of course, they're all brain-hungry zombies just waiting to get let out!This film is garbage. Sure, there's some well secquenced fight scenes, & they way the computer tries offing the specialist secutirty unit is also interesting.

"For some reason I always thought this film was older than 1979...in any case this ""American-ized"" version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol stars Henry Winkler as the SCrooge character who is renamed Benedict Slade.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity when this ABC made for TV movie came out so I'm certain that's why he was cast.  Unfortunately you just can't see anything but Fonzie, even under layers and layers of make-up.The scene is shifted from 1840's London to  Depression-era New England, as miserly businessman Slade receives a long-overdue attitude adjustment one Christmas eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures who resemble three of the people whose possessions Slade had seized to collect on unpaid loans. Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story, the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways, and he becomes a caring, generous, amiable man.In a bit of ridiculousness, the ""Ghost of Christmas Future"" is portrayed by a black man wearing gold chains, dressed in 1979 fashions and listens to disco music. Their ""Ghost of the Future"" jumped a little too far ahead, and is comical by todays standards.Winkler does an admirable job in his role and Dorian Harewood really shines.  Still...Dickens is a classic...why ABC felt a need to revise something so perfect is beyond me.  This is a good change of pace but if you really like ""A CHristmas Carol"" stick with the Alastair Sim or George C. Scott versions.",1102377600,"12 7, 2004"

"I am an eighties baby so being how I was born in the golden age of horror films it should be no surprise that I'm a huge fan of the genre, in fact it's my favorite genre by far. I think it is human nature to be nostalgic about certain things. It's why the WWII generation hated rock & roll, and why baby boomers hate hip hop, because it's not from THEIRtime so somehow it's inferior. Because of this when the 90's came along and all of the great horror series of the bygone decade were running out of steam (Halloween, Friday the 13th, A nightmare on elm street) horror movies were still around just not being pumped out week after week at the cinemas. That's until scream arrived in '96 giving the horror genre much needed jolt in the arm.Seemingly overnight they were back again, one new film after the other and we as horror fans couldn't have been happier!Okay, okay, okay, I know what your thinking, this is suppose to be a customer review of I still know...and this guy is giving us a history lesson on the genre as a whole, but there's a method to my madness, you see I remember being excited when I saw the first I know what you did...I remember enjoying it, and of coarse when I heard of a sequel I was more than sold on going to see it, which I did, and enjoyed it! Enjoyed it when it came out on video, hec, I even bought the DVD which I still have to this day, but all of those years I watched the actually thinking it was a quality film, it ISN'T! What changed my mind you ask well a little thing called growing up, and when you grow up hindsight is 20\20.You see I know now why I really thought this film was good when I was a kid, HORROR was back back in a big way so I would, and did go to see any and everything back then and usually enjoyed the movies, but know as an adult I realize this movie is goofy at best.I think I first realized it one night a few years ago when I caught it on tv. Nothing else was one so I decided to watchit. It was like I was seeing it for the first time with new adult eyes and I realized how ridiculous it was.I could go into the plot in more detail but if you guys are reading this you probably already know the deal. Let's just say JLH survived ""slicker guy"" in the first film and now his back to finish the job, but this time there on an island with a scary old guy, someone who I think may be Jack Black in a bad wig, and POP STAR BRANDY! It's ridiculous from start to finish, from how they are lured to the island, why they are lured to the island and the goofy kills that happen throughout.There are things that happen that are so ridiculous(Freddie Prinze Jr's character hijacking a boat at gunpoint and sailing through a storm, at NIGHT no less to save his ladylove but I mean it's JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT after all, you wouldn't do the same?Despite realizing now as an adult that this movie was simply just a way to cash-in further on the who's the killer genre before the public lost interest it still is entertaining and fun to watch!If you've been living under a rock and somehow have never seen the I know what you did...films watch the first one first (a much better, well made film) than watch this one next, but when watching the sequel forget about LOGIC, and good storytelling, just seat back and enjoy a bunch of pretty actors running around an island being chased by a guy in a raincoat!Is this movie good? - Not in the slightest bit!Is this movie entertaining? - HELL YES!!!!!!P. S. Don't forget to checkout a certain character's death by hook that is quite possibly the WORST CGI ever in the history of CGI, it's hilarious!!!!!!",1436745600,"07 13, 2015"

I really don't want to say it because I loved the first two seasons of Sherlock but this one was lacking.  I need to go back and watch it over again to figure out exactly what was missing.  But I hope that they have figured out that the changes that they made didn't work.  I will watch the next season on the hopes that they have went back to the original formula.,1409443200,"08 31, 2014"
"I watched it till the middle and wanted to throw it away. I't's an insult to the game. The acting was terrible. The story line was obvious and uninteresting. It was generally meant for those who had played the game.but I can promise you that if you have played resident evil three, you will find nothing to intrest you here. The game has more drama, more suspense more interesting and intelligent twists that the movie appalingly lacked. In my oppinion the movie itself was a good introduction, I hope the next movie will take up from there and give us something worth watching!!!!",1109548800,"02 28, 2005"

An excellent series that I had seen only part of when it was on TV.  A recent trip to South Africa brought this series to mind and I am enjoying seeing it more now that I have been to South Africa.  The  quality of the DVD is what you would expect from a VCR of that era.,1402358400,"06 10, 2014"
Sony has re-released this show in a regular dvd case with the 3 disc on top of each other.  This is CHEAP and LAZY.  Seek out the original packaging.  It's pretty bad that a company -any company- tries to save money but at the same time sells something that will most likely be damaged or get damaged in a way they should have known before they manufactured it.

"i love this movie and most of bergman's early material.  beautifully shot, profound metaphor, and dynamic acting all fall under bergman's talent.  my only complaint: where is the commentary track?  when criterion usually releases movies, especially with the more popular directors, they add a commentary track by some film historian.  it is oddly missing.  makes me wonder if they plan a double dip and re-release this at a later date with added material.  something that they have done in the past.  with the amount of work and preparation that goes into presenting these movies, you would think a commentary track would be a no brainer and adding it later on is basically ripping off the consumer and collector.",1290211200,"11 20, 2010"

"After being ressurrected by flaming dog urine, Freddy [Robert Englund] returns once more to haunt the remaining kids of Elm Street. This is the movie where the campiness begins to really take hold of the series. While Freddy is still entertaining, he's no longer as menacing as he was in the previous installments. This film is not a total waste as there are good special effects and a few thrills here and there and you can at least get through this one without falling asleep due to constant boredom. And although they do the best they can with the script they have, the cast of characters here are not up to par with the previous film's cast which sinks this film a little more and i do believe that this would be the last halfway decent Nightmare movie until New Nightmare as the quality of the series has begun to slip here and would only get worse for the next couple of movies. If you love all things Freddy or if you like cheesy 80's horror flicks, then give this movie a watch.",1303862400,"04 27, 2011"
"When I saw ""Resident Evil"" I like it, although it was a free version of the game, of the story. But ""Resident Evil - Apocalypse"", it's disastrous. With a useless explanation by Alice of what happened in the first film and flashbacks. I think they made some kind of mistake when editing the film because the story can be confusing. The dialogues are bad and the performance terrible; why make Alice look tough in the film? And the zombies almost doesn't appear. The special effects are bad and Nemesis is just a mass of makeup, not to mention the music. The only good thing in the movie is Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory, which perfomance as a sexy policewoman reults unbelieveable.",1133827200,"12 6, 2005"

Plus, I wanted to relive a classic in classic form because I forgot the original ending. Also because it reminded me of the first time I heard it. I was in the second or third grade and we had substitute teacher this particular day. He decided to read the story to us and I thought from the description of Icabod Crane that he was describing himself. The man was the same height and build as the character. He even had a pointy nose. The only differences were the teacher was African American, had an Afro and wore glasses but the description had us all saying the same thing, ""He's talking about himself.""

"This isn't a bad zombie movie, but then again it isn't a good one either. Although one knows what to expect in such a movie,any kind of plot usually keeps things exciting. In this casehowever the plot is not particularly interesting. As so many people get slaughtered during the first 20 minutes, we theviewers do not really care anymore about a little girl getting saved or not. Milla Jovovitch's stunt fights are surreal and her battle with Nemesis, clearly a distant relative of an Uruk-Hai from Lord of the rings, looks silly. I think this movie is unlucky that the crowd's appetite for zombie movies is starting to temper a little. We now want a reasonable story as well.Just shooting zombies isn't enough anymore. Shame about this movie though, as it obviously is a lot better than the previous part. This just looks like a wasted opportunity.(SARR)",1131840000,"11 13, 2005"

"The trailers for ""Idle Hands"" implied the film was a madcap horror comedy when, in reality, the filmmakers created something more along the lines of ""An American Werewolf in London."" Granted, they don't come near the high water mark of that film, or even the later ""Fright Night"" or ""The Lost Boys,"" but ""Idle Hands"" has genuine moments of horror along with its comedy, although neither element is particularly memorable.From the icky premise to the icky undead friends acting as Greek chorus to the hot babe inexplicably drawn to the protagonist to the dark finale, ""Idle Hands"" bears the mark of the creators watching ""American Werewolf"" over and over and over again while creating this film.Of course, it's not as though ""An American Werewolf in London"" is difficult to find at your local video store. For those looking for those sorts of thrills, stick with the original, as well as ""Fright Night"" and ""Lost Boys.""""Idle Hands"" is a recommended rental for fans of Seth Green or Jessica Alba, but other horror fans should give it a miss.",1122508800,"07 28, 2005"

"Apparently, Spielberg said he made War of the Worlds because it would be `fun' to do nasty aliens for a change. But just how `cuddly and benevolent' were these particular ET's? They terrorise a mother to within an inch of her life, pulling her child out of her own arms leaving her distraught and not knowing whether he is alive or dead. Why did they do that when they had dozens of adult abductees that had perfectly useful mature brains for study? Nasty aliens. And what about those adult abductees? Second World War guys, torn from wives or girlfriends. True love gone forever. Their parents probably dead in the interim. On top of that trauma they now have to adjust to a new world where they don't fit in. The result: depression and alcoholism, maybe even suicide. Nasty, nasty aliens. Then to cap it all off they come out of their mother ship naked and expose themselves to the reception committee. Sexual assault can be extremely traumatic, resulting in long term psychological problems. Except the French guy who no doubt treats that sort of thing with a Gallic shrug. Nasty, nasty, nasty aliens.Spielberg is fooling nobody but himself. See War of the Worlds, by the way, it's great. There's no plot, though.",1120608000,"07 6, 2005"

UGH!Added to all this, there were no characters one could care about. Filled with cliche's, like the prostitute who dreamed of meeting a rich man to take her away from it all.I watched to the end to see if there might be a twist or some punch added, but it stayed a completely, painfully boring movie to the very, very end!",1307404800,"06 7, 2011"

"This director really has only one good movie - ""Event Horizon"" - and everything else is just plain bad, Resident Evil being absolutely no exception to this general rule of thumb and God help ""Aliens Vs Predator"" with the way things are shaping up.This film is marginally better than Ghosts of Mars, but only because Milla Jovovich goes around the place in a really very short mini-skirt and just happens to get skin sticking wet clothes towards the end of the picture. Overall the movie has extremely low production values and even lower prospects in the execution of the film. All of the sets looked contrived, i.e - they have no point being there other than to match scenes in the computer game or look interesting. Oh, yeah did we mention that this is based on a computer game? No, okay lets back up a bit here... Resident Evil just happens to be a really popular 3rd person zombie shoot 'em up horror survival game that they are now selling as a movie. Okay, let's move on...When the actors in this film are more robotic than the characters in the game then you know something has gone seriously wrong... and it has. Nobody in the cast is mildly recognizable except for Milla Jovovich, and they shouldn't be either, because they all suck real bad. The camera work is some of the worse seen in a long time. Why? Because it attracts attention itself almost all of time. Bad cinematography. For 35mm it looks like it was shot on video. The lighting is pretty good whenever it turns on or off but when it is static it is just useless. The editing is extremely bad at times and cuts fail to match. From an atheistic standpoint its all terrible production values for a Hollywood budget. The CGI also happens to be extremely, EXTREMELY, dodgy most of the times. You know when the animation looks like animation? Well x 100 times worse is what you get here. It looks terribly fake, and even the dogs covered in RED PAINT look very cheesy. Overall this is a really really really very bad production. The story is worse and even some of the.......Bah.Forget about me writing anymore. Not worth it. Just go play the game instead.",1075593600,"02 1, 2004"

"If anyone prior to this doubted that either Williams or Bridges could do fully fleshed out characters with dramatic gravitas, this movie answered that question once and for all. Boy, could the two of them do it all in the movies. Bridges plays an obnoxious radio tv talk guy who makes a life altering mistake on his show. Robin Williams plays Parry, the homeless man who in the circle of life is caught in the rays of what radiates out from that mistake. They will create something positive out of this but it is coming out of the darkest of the dark to do so. Either Williams or Bridges should have won the Oscar for this, perhaps both, but they did not. It did show the movie going world though that Bridges had been consistently underestimated up to that point and he began getting parts instead worthy of his talent. The female roles were fully realized by Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer and they are beacons for coming home and out of the darkness and into the light.

"First of all the CG sucked. Second, Michelle Rodriguez can't act. She rolls her eyes to the back of her head with every line as if to make it more intense and stronger, it doesn't work. The movie doesn't really follow the game much. And although I never thought about this until I heard someone else say it, why would the computer send out all those little lasers and not just the ""net laser"" if it's job was to kill any and everything? The answer is, so they can include more unecessary action without incorporating it more smoothly and intelligently.If you want to see a good zombie flick, rent the original Night of the Living Dead.",1108684800,"02 18, 2005"

"When a group that's the real flavour of the moment decides to make a movie, it'll either be a total success or a total flop, depending upon how universally-loved the group is.  The Beatles are hands down the most successful (Hard Day's Night, Help!) due to their immortalized status.  Others have not been so, e.g. Herman's Hermits, Bill Haley.  The Spice Girls kind of fall inbetween the two.The primary influence is probably A Hard Day's Night.  Spiceworld is, after all, a day in the life of the Girls, and includes  musical numbers, an uptight manager, and a triumphant concert number.  Needless to say, it will never stand side-by-side with the Beatles' groundbreaking classic.One credit in their favour is the scene where they parody their own personalities.  Victoria, for example, can't decide whether to wear the black Gucci dress, the black Gucci dress, or the black Gucci dress in her closet.  To which Emma successfully suggests, ""why don't you wear the black Gucci dress?""  Emma's baby-like innocence is also parodied.  And Geri's misquote on the Pope is a parody of what John Lennon said about Jesus.They seem to have the most fun trying on different costumes in the ""Saturday Night Divas"" number.  Geri as Marilyn Monroe in The Seven Year Itch and Wonder Woman shines out in particular, as do Mel C. and Geri as Danny and Sandy from Grease, and Victoria as Honey Rider in Dr. No.  But the best is when some of them dress up as each other.There are some subplots along the way, such as a documentary team following the Girls, the Girls' very pregnant friend Nicola who pops up every now and then, and a tabloid publisher who hates the girls so much, he hatches a plot to tarnish their image.  The tensions between the girls and their uptight manager Clifford, and an American film producer (George Wendt of Cheers) who consults Clifford to discuss a movie deal involving the girls.  Their Spice Force Five idea (think Spice Girls as Charlie's Angels) is actually a good segment.There are amusing guest cameos from well-known British actors and singers, such as Richard Briers, Hugh Laurie (Wooster in Jeeves and Wooster), Stephen Fry (Jeeves in J and W), Bob Geldof, Elvis Costello, Elton John, and AbFab's Jennifer Saunders.I doubt if Roger Moore would consider this movie as his best performance, but he seems to be enjoying himself as the Girls' behind-the-scenes handler, with some really hideous lines:  ""The drummer without sticks has no backbeat.""  Richard E. Grant though gets noteworthy mention as Clifford.  The scene of him having a real fit at seeing tabloid headlines bashing the girls is funny, but the girls laugh it off and even make fun of him, which makes him even madder.  Meat Loaf is Dennis, the Girls' loyal bus driver, and there's an in-joke when he's asked to add repairing the bus-toilet to his list of duties.  ""I love those girls.  I'll do anything for them, but I won't do that.""  Hint:  his last hit single.The performances in this movie may depend upon which Spice Girl is your favourite.  In my case, it's Geri, Emma, and Mel C. in that order, but love or hate the movie, all the Spice Girls are still very charming and lovable.  Songs done in this movie in order:  ""Too Much"", ""Do It"", ""Say You Will Be There"", ""Mama"", ""Denying"", ""Saturday Night Divas"", ""Stop"", ""2 Become 1"", ""Leader Of The Gang"", ""Never Give Up On The Good Times"", ""My Boy Lollipop"", ""Wannabe"", ""Viva Forever"", ""Who Do You Think You Are"", ""Spice Up Your Life"", and ""The Lady Is A Vamp.""Had I reviewed this in the throes of my Spice-induced euphoria of 1998, I would have given this the max.

"Twenty years ago, a movie like ""Resident Evil"" would have been considered a horror masterpiece, heralded for its social commentary on the evils of the advancement of mankind, and praised for its stunning array of action sequences and make-up and special effects. Here, in the age of movies like last's year's ""Thirteen Ghosts"" and countless other entries into the horror genre, it's a big, obnoxious, at times baffling effects show fueled by incoherence and banality.The film is derived from a popular video game franchise, which would explain why the plot feels jumbled, or why its characters feel flaccid and empty. It begins with an introduction that is aggravating in its choice of leaving too much in the dark to be explained later in a less-than-admirable manner. The world is dominated by major corporations, many of which deal in such things as genetic and viral testing and experimentation. In a series of chain reactions, an underground laboratory known as the Hive is contaminated by a viral strand, after which its computer, referred to as the Red Queen, begins the containment process, locking its hundreds of employees within the complex, and extinguishing them.Enter Milla Jovovich (character names matter not in such a film), who awakens after a fall in the shower to find a mysterious scar on her shoulder, a strange note left in her bedroom, and a dresser drawer that holds a full arsenal of weaponry. Equally unsettling is the storming of her elite home, where she, along with Eric Mabius, is taken into an underground cavern through a hidden door in her home, and transported by rail to the Hive. This sequence, as well as those to come, is poorly shot, with the use of flashy cinematography and quick-cuts; it matters little, though, because to see it clearly would not be to like it more.The underground setting itself is another slap in the face, being everything you'd expect from a movie such as this: endless hallways of steel, an abundance of fluorescent lighting, and a sense of claustrophobia that goes unnoticed in director Paul Anderson's eyes. Joining Jovovich and Mabius is a team of gun-toting security guards led by Michelle Rodriguez. The objective of their mission centers on the Red Queen, whom they must reboot in order to regain access to the Hive's many chambers, presumably to find some answers to the lockdown.The real evil that resides here is the story's desperation to try and provide coherent solutions to its mysteries. Once things start going awry after the opened doors release the many undead facility workers, victims of the viral strand, the story descends further into camp territory, recalling plot twists and surprises from previous horror and science fiction films, some better, some of the same caliber.... The overall film boasts a loud, aggressive soundtrack replete with heavy bass and ear-splitting treble, becoming aggravating and obnoxious without ever attaining our interest. There are innumerable amounts of quick jolts, in which undead zombies jump onto screen to a beat of the music; the abundance of such tactics quickly grows tiresome and redundant. The antagonists themselves, from the sleep-walking zombies and inside-out Dobermans, to the clich-riddled monster that can change form and attain the strength of its victims, do nothing to raise the fear factor, providing more laughs than scares.On those grounds, ""Resident Evil"" is little more than another horror entry riddled with familiarity and incoherence, banal characters and lousy plotting, that feels less like a movie and more like disjointed cinematic interludes that appear during the course of a video game.",1017964800,"04 5, 2002"

"I remember seeing this at the theater and thought the DVD would be a good addition to my collection. My memory of the story was better than the DVD turned out to be. Too many special effects have happened since this movie first came out, and they make the ones in Close Encounters look contrived. I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought it would. If you find it on sale you might want to pick it up.",1011398400,"01 19, 2002"

"Got here in time, the show wasn't so bad but could had been better",1481155200,"12 8, 2016"
One of my top five favorite movies. It will make you think. There really is no villain. Both lead characters are right...and wrong. Both want to do the right thing... but have such vastly different views on how to get there that circumstances lock them in a life and death struggle. Lots of action...tension...and a satisfying ending... but one that leaves you with important questions to ponder.,1377129600,"08 22, 2013"
Not bad. Not as good as west world but it's a decent story,1477785600,"10 30, 2016"

"This is the kind of movie that would be compared to something like Chopper Chicks in Zombietown. It has all the laughs, some frights, but too funny to take seriously. That's the issue with Idle Hands. Devon Sawa doesn't take the fact that his parents are dead very emotionally, which is weird.The only part of this movie I really hate is the ending. It completely stunk, and made me agree that it was only a two and a half star movie. There are a lot of people who still like this movie and I hink it's great. But to give this film three stars is silly.I could watch this movie again and still find it funny. That's about how good it is.",994636800,"07 9, 2001"

"Considered to be one of the biggest summer disappointments of 1993, Last Action Hero tried to get its name out there by being the next big name action flick, and it sure did disappoint many. Here's a thing to keep in mind though: this is actually a PARODY of the action genre that just happens to have Arnold Schwarzenegger in it. It's not trying to be a replica of the big names such as Terminator, Predator, or even Commando (which was unintentionally hilarious, by the way). Instead, it's an inside joke in the style of a sketch comedy skit, except it's drawn out much longer. While I personally don't think that Last Action Hero is terrible by any means, it doesn't mean that's it flawless.Arnold manages to play two characters in this film: the far more present cinematic world character Jack Slater, and the real life version of himself. He is obviously the reason why you would want to see this movie, and throughout the film, he makes fun of his stereotypical character by using over-the-top one liners and using unorthodox methods of action scenes. There's some hilarious jokes that he says throughout, and along with him, we even manage to see other film icons playing some of their trademark parts, including Robert Patrick dressed up as the T-1000, Sharon Stone's role as Catherine Tramell, and one of my personal favorites, Sylvester Stallone as The Terminator on a cardboard cutout. While I do enjoy the comedic, over-the-top bits that obviously point out the Hollywood cliches, this film suffers from drawing these out too long amongst its script. Sometimes they tend to be unnecessary and at others rather boring.Also, I found the child protagonist played by Austin O'Brien to be rather annoying. Part of me thinks that they used the idea of him teaming up with Schwarzy from T2, where Edward Furlong was the child protagonist. While Furlong was clever, funny and acted well, O'Brien tries too hard to be a mastermind behind the typical action film. I understand that the role of a child was necessary for this to work, seeing how he managed to magically appear in the movie with his favorite action hero, but it could have been done far better with someone that could pull it off in a far less annoying fashion.In a way, I tend to find Last Action Hero to be an enjoyable popcorn flick that tried something new by being a hidden parody. It was a major risk for director John McTiernan, screenwriter Shane Black (who ironically rewrote the script despite Zak Penn and Adam Leff having it a tongue-in-cheek reference to Black's style), and Arnold, but as a parody, it works. It's just a far cry from what we would expect from a cast like aforementioned.",1307232000,"06 5, 2011"
The cinematography was too old.  Couldn't hardly see the characters.  I only watched the first 10-15 minutes.  Didn't enjoy it.,1396396800,"04 2, 2014"
"It was interesting, but not a lot of depth or development of the characters.",1443398400,"09 28, 2015"
"It seemed like it was going to get interesting but never did. The should have wrapped the story up in one season instead of dragging it across four seasons with slow-to-no progress in each episode. Just same/similar story and action in every episode and got increasingly redundant, boring, and stupid. Any reasonable person would have gone to the police with the information. Everyone who's watched a slasher movie knows to ensure the killer is dead. There's no bad reason to skip this show.",1500768000,"07 23, 2017"

"I gave it 3 stars because I love this movie too much for just a single star. The reason why I gave this 3 stars is for one reason and one reason only, no Widescreen. It's a slap in the face to the fans and the cast members out there who have worked hard making this film and the fans who have supported the musical over the years.As an avid DVD collector, I like to buy Widescreen because I never liked the thought of having a film 'cut to pieces' to fit my TV screen. Annie 20th Anniversary of course is no exception.Hopefully Columbia will hear our voices about this and release Widescreen in the next few months...with the same extra features.I'm not giving up on this, not by a long shot. ;)",1074038400,"01 14, 2004"

"I just watched this movie tonight for the first time. I never knew about this movie until a couple weeks ago. While looking for movies to watch i came across this movie and was immediately attracted to it. I have to say that there were some scenes that at times seemed too ""ridiculous"" in a sense that It was hard to believe. Spoiler alert!  like when the guy walked around without anyone noticing it was him they were looking for even though his picture was everywhere). It was also hard to believe that in those days with such technology Cops were not able to locate the guy on the wheelchair  you would think that in the future police will be able to track anyone anywhere.)It was also crazy the lack of technology. Having said this, I have to confess that I have realized that those things are not relevant in the purpose of the movie . I mean sure they could have done better things but let us not forget this movie came out in 1999  i believe). So it's understandable that ""technology "" was not shown on a higher level. At the same time those things I just explained, Do not interfere with the great message of this gem. I really love this movie , I love the fact that the main character is someone with a lot of disadvantages in his life yet he manages to become even better than those who had it easier. It's a inspiring movie because it teaches us that "" where there is a will there is a way"". In my life it inspires me to not give up on my dreams and to fight for what I believe to be true.",1317513600,"10 2, 2011"

"This is not the best film by Besson. In fact it is in many ways incredibly naive and superficial, even in its desire to look and sound profound. Profundity is not only political gibberish diplomatic slang. And it is that kind of language that reduces the attitude of the French king to be and then king to opportunism. And it is that kind of language that reduces the attitude of bishop Cochon to servile non-commitment. And it is that kind of language that reduces the attitude of the English to vengeful cruelty. It is also very superficial to reduce simple people to blind believers of anything that sounds iffy, godlike and slightly insane, like a girl leading an army or hearing and listening to divine voices. But all that must please many simple minds indeed. It is a shame because the subject deserves a serious film, a serious approach. Shakespeare forgot to write this play. He could have written a masterpiece on the subject. Besson just writes an average action film, some kind of medieval peplum film.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",1164153600,"11 22, 2006"

"""Gattaca"" (1997 - 112 minutes) is one of the best scientific fiction movies of the 90 years. Deep, overwhelming and controversial, it was written and directed by Andrew Niccol. Gattaca, the name of a specific DNA strain sequence of the human body, is also the denomination of a space trip megacorporation. The society described in the narrative adopts the genetic manipulation to improve the attributes of each human being. In fact, the people are classified as ""valids"" [or perfect conceived in laboratory] and ""invalids"" [conceived by the natural method]. Vincent Freeman [the actor Ethan Hawke] is one of ""invalids"" having to support his stigma of birth, beyond other imperfections. He has an illness that limits his life to 30 years - in contrast to his younger brother, Anton [Loren Dean], that was designed genetically and is a member of the elite. But Vincent did not accept his destiny. He aims for changing his life and fulfill his dreams, travelling to other planets. To qualify himself as a space pilot, the young one would have to be ""perfect"" or ""valid"". As in that society the identity of someone was not confirmed by documents but by their genes, Vincent perceives that he has to turn himself into another person to obtain what he wants. Through a DNA trader, he knows Jerome Eugene Morrow [the actor Jude Law], a superior being that was paralyzed  in an accident and was excluded from the society. Using samples of blood, hair, skin and urine of Jerome, Vincent assumes his identity, becoming a navigator. Vincent also falls in love for the pretty Irene [the actress Uma Thurman], his colleague in Gattaca, that does not know his true identity. One week before the space mission, a murder in Gattaca starts an inquiry led for Anton, that is a policeman. Vincent is in a great danger to be discovered.The main message of the film is that there is no genes for the spirit. Extraordinary.",1096761600,"10 3, 2004"
"What could have been a great character study - a Feminist determined to provide her daughter with a wholesome life while she watches Mom take her clothes off on stage; who still fights an impulse towards exhibitionism - emerges as foolish, pandering pulp.So we have a great writer and two fine actors (Moore and Reynolds) delivering something pretty embarassing. Reynolds is awful as the sleazy politician who has his own urge to drop his pants in public.That said, Demi Moore is *the* reason to watch this movie, beginning to end. She acts well, and dances even...weller.",1282176000,"08 19, 2010"
"There was a time, long, long ago when the Silver Screen was reserved for for classics, for art, for the Golden Age of Hollywood. Those days are long gone. But at least movies had that special time. Video Games will never be regarded in this way. No matter how realistic and frightening the Resident Evil games can be the world of gaming will never be able to shed the geeky image of friendless, degenerate nerds playing for 11-hours straight. There's no glamour or admiration to be had here. And with the worlds of movies and video games merging closer and closer together (whether we like it or not) we can only expect a Sonic the Hedgehog live action movie soon (and some studio exec will probably cast Ben Affleck in the title role). I may sound like I'm talking nonsense, but, when you think about it...not really. We've already had a Super Mario Bros. movie and Double Dragon and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and Alone in the Dark.The first Resident Evil movie was no classic that's for damn sure but it's still a far superior film to this drek. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is so wantonly awful it's almost on par with House of the Dead. No joke! These zombies are not scary! At all! Dawn of the Dead this ain't.For an R-rated movie the violence is blurred and confusing, why even bother with the swearing if that is really all that is keeping it from being a PG-13? It's shot and cut with no skill whatsoever. The plot makes no sense at all and there are frequent gaps in logic that even the most ignorant viewer can point out. Like why do the long-dead people in the graveyard (conveniently buried underneath only a few centimetres of loose dirt) suddenly come back to life when the T-virus is only supposed to be transfered through blood infection? And that was only just one part of a 'plot' that was constant nonsense. And by the end it was so far removed from the (better) story of the video games that the 'Resident Evil' title is really no more than a way of selling nonsense to people who expect and deserve something else.Don't get me started on the characters! All I can say about them is that they might as well have been polygons. I know I'm not being really original when I say this movie is like watching a bunch of cut-scenes from a video game but...it is. It is totally NOT worth your time or money. Do not even give in to curiosity.The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and (my version had) Dolby EX/DTS ES 6.1 sound. Plus a bunch of extras I care not for.",1109980800,"03 5, 2005"

"A Gratin of spastic awkward forced contoversy fisting its way stiffly through its 1950's girdle, Naked Kiss seeks to be a controversial film yet doesn't feel remotely real in any way. Comically sad and stiffly acted, it is the epitome of a 1950's ""B"" movie (although a ""B"" may be somewhat kind) it is the vegas lounge singer of movies not purposefully campy or kitsch, it truly tries to get off the ground but has no wings... or legs for that matter yet it nobly pushes forth its best effort and THAT is the stuff of which genres are born.In many ways, this film is kind of what the transition between the '50's & '60's were about. An awkward attempt to grow up too fast without knowing how. We get to watch the spasmotic growing pains of the ""Me generation"" pushing farther & faster than they can handle.Come for the cheese, stay for the quirkyness.",1156809600,"08 29, 2006"

I watched the extras and all I learned is that the monster is a baby, which you don't get from the movie. You don't know what it is, where it came from, why it is here or why the movie is called Cloverfield when it takes place in NY. There were too many unanswered questions. Also, really who would hold on to a stupid camera that long and go back for it when it is dropped. Movie is pathetic, stupid and boring, also has a stupid ending.

"This is a story of a ""good boy"" turned into a big drug dealer, including all the usual elements- the way up, the pretty wife, the cars, the riches, the betrayal of a good friend and then all the way down. Sounds familiar? Yes, you have seen it in ""Scar face"" and other movies of the same kind, only there the story was more interesting; Cruel maybe, but with some reasoning - you could understand the motives behind the actions of the heroes (be it to advance, to prove their power, to control) and you got immersed in the logic of the drug world.  This movie on the other hand is neither convincing in its logic or characters nor presented in an interesting manner. Contrary to what we expect the movie is also non violent and this fact (which in other cases could have been appreciated by me) makes it not credible, or rather covering up the truth more then disclosing as we know the events have truly happened.George, the `good boy"", played by Johnny Depp is presented as some kind of tragic hero. Someone who got involved in ""bad things"" but really just wanted to live in peace and quiet with his family...The only explanation we get for his turn to crime was that his mom always used to nag his dad for money...Everything his dad earned was not enough. George then promised himself that he will always have money.George gets into the drug business as if by mistake, just to earn some quick money for him and his friends (""these were great days""...he says with nostalgia). He was the mind behind the group of good kids and devises techniques of drug delivery while using his girlfriend Barbara as a carrier. The drugs are sold to other ""good kids"" from universities and colleges and the techniques of drug delivery grows more sophisticated as there is rise in demand. We never get to see the ""end customers"" or the final sale process which I assume could have been interesting to watch. Barbara dies from cancer (""I really loved her"") and George starts making big money by joining with the Boss, the famous Escobar, a symbol of the drug world and its corruption. However, not in this movie... The drug world presented here is clean of violence. The Colombian farmers are nave and nice and even the scene with Escobar is quite mellow, besides maybe one shot.  In George's jail periods we learn about the qualities of cocaine (good cocaine melts only in 86 degrees) but these facts seem to be the only gain from this movie.I have just seen Johnny Depp as a charming Pirate in the new film ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" where he just shines through - here however, except for his beauty there are no signs of the famous Depp magic. Here his beauty is not enough to save his role from total shallowness. His gestures and facial expressions are void of any true feelings.Penelope Cruz who plays the beautiful wife is one of my favorite actresses. However, I have to admit that even she does a lousy job here. Maybe it's not her fault as her role is of the spoiled rich wife who does nothing but be pretty and smoke drugs - however, her part is a pale replica of the part Michelle Pfeiffer does in scar face and she does not manage to look convincing, nor is it clear what besides her looks, drew George to her. Penelope Cruz hardly appears in the movie and I did not appreciate the fact that her picture is the one appearing on the cover of this movie. Ray Liota and Rachel Griffiths play George's parents, and although Ray Liota is convincing as the father, the mother seems the same age as her son and she does not seem to bring anything to this role.I must confess that in several parts this movie seems like an ""ordered movie"" to clean the name of George Jung or at least present him in a human light as the movie is so one sided and unconvincing. In the end we see George in prison, waiting and hoping that his daughter would come to visit... the movie is filled with manipulations such as this one who are meant to make you feel sorry for this man.",1061078400,"08 17, 2003"

"This ""feel good"" 1949 Western film romanticizes the life of the U.S. Cavalry on the ""Indian"" front amidst personal dramas most notably focused upon which young man will get a certain woman (Miss Dandridge played by Joanne Dru) as their wife. John Wayne plays an old officer who is just a few days away from retirement when the ""Indian"" problem boils over. In this picture Wayne's character is clever rather than ""charge forward and worry about things later"" very typical in his later career. His sidekick Sergeant Quincannon had some of the more humorous moments (played by Victor McLagen).A good job was made in references to the American Civil War as well as various officers in the U.S. Cavalry who had been a lot higher in rank in the Confederacy but were now several notches down. There's an old fellow who is a very minor character and dies and this lowly officer is later mentioned as a brigadier general of the Confederacy.At the very end Wayne's character comes to realize how much the U.S. Cavalry means to his identity.The film was directed by John Ford and part of his U.S. Cavalry trilogy. The movie just before this one was ""Fort Apache"" and the one right after was ""Rio Grande"". Of the three I think I most like ""Rio Grande"". Anyway, this particular picture won an Academy Award for Best Colored Cinematography for its sweeping views of Monument Valley (located in upper Arizona).I graded this film its period. It would be unfair to compare certain parts to the movies of today.STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B to B plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; ACTION SCENES: B minus; MUSIC: B plus; HISTORICAL TOUCHES: B; WHEN WATCHED: early August 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B.",1344556800,"08 10, 2012"

Eden was superb in the lead. She was amazing at conveying both sex appeal and innocence at the same time. The characters on the show are sometimes a little uneven by the way they're written from ep to ep but the talent of the actors overcomes this small fault. I liked the show much better when it switched to color (it was rather dour in black and white). And I like the married Genie stories as much as the eps where's she is single.,1101600000,"11 28, 2004"

"Back in 1996 the original Independence Day was probably one of the most fun movies ever made (at least up until then).  It wasn't Citizen Kane but it was the perfect Summer movie.  It was funny, had characters we loved, the story was great, the special effects were top notch & you walked out at the end with a giant grin on your face.  I can remember sitting in the theater on a Saturday afternoon on opening weekend when the entire place broke out into cheers at the end when Randy Quaid's unlikely hero saves the day.When I heard they were making a sequel I was hesitant but looked forward to it because I thought if it was half as good as the first it would be worth it.Boy was I in for a let down.  I honestly don't even remember much about it.  It was so God-awful all I really remember is about 10 minutes into it I kept looking at my watch to see how much longer it would be and how soon before I could go have a drink.I seriously cant put enough emphasis on just how awful this is.

"My boyfriend came home with this movie one day as a surprise.  I hadn't really cared to watch it because the trailer made it look just so-so.  Turns out, the trailer and my guess were right.  Of course the acting was good, Johnny Depp and Helen Bonham Carter are always great - especially together - and that new witch lady that hasn't been in much else was good.The plot, however, was just average.  The comedy was also just average - I was expecting to laugh a lot more than I did.  The love story?  Below average.  I wasn't feeling the connection at all.If it were up to me, I'd spend about $5 on this movie, and not a penny more.  It's a decent one time watch if you're bored.",1351900800,"11 3, 2012"
Horrible by far as what I generally like watching. The movie is bloody like what the movie portrays but the acting is extremely horrible I watched maybe one scene and I was more interested in playing a phone game rather than watch the whole movie.

"I'm a big Jane Eyre fan, and the book is one of my favorites; thus, I've seen most of the different versions of this famous classic. I loved Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke (I thought the dialogues and Dalton's portrayal of Rochester were unforgettable) and Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson (I loved the chemistry between them) versions. I was hoping that this adaptation was also great especially with Ciaran Hinds in it. However, I was somewhat disappointed. I understand that this version is much shorter than above mentioned adaptations, but still not showing such important scenes like aunt Reed deathbed confession or not giving any explanation who St. John and his sisters (in this version only one sister) are to Jane were disappointing. Also I thought that the scene with Jane and Rochester meeting Blanche while on the way to shopping was useless. However, if you are not familiar with the novel or other adaptations you might like this one. It's basically poor governess falling in love with a master of the house. I gave it 3 stars because of the beautiful scenery, costumes, and settings, and also I thought that Jane and Rochester's age difference was more appropriately portrayed than in other versions. If you're not familiar with Jane Eyre story, I would recommend that you pick up the book or watch Dalton/Clarke version (it's most faithful to the novel) before watching this movie.",1268524800,"03 14, 2010"
"Horrible movie. Boring, and certainly was a waste of my money. It was very hard to sit through. The commercials threw me off, of course I should have realized that part of marketing strategy is to fool consumers and show the best parts of the movies. There was no action like I expected, way too much talking, and the plot sucked. And for the kids? Yeah right, there was a soft porn scene in it, with kids in the theatre. But then again, the film was rated R. But if thats the case then the Spice channel which shows soft porn should be available for everyone to watch, it was literally the same thing. That probably was the highlight for many people in the cinema, but it did not help the movie. Sometimes I wonder why producers and directors go on with movies if its clearly a horrible project.

"I would really rate this as 3.5 stars but not 4, so I'm forced to give it a 3.First off, the movie overall is excellent. Heck, I was 11 years old when this came out and I LIVED in Muncie, Indiana when it was released. The theater went nuts when the subtitle came on, saying ""Muncie, IN"", and then seeing Roy wearing a Ball State University shirt, well that just got the crowd in the theatre all worked up. We loved it!I saw the ""Special Edition"" on VHS when it came out. I was a little diasppointed at the time when the scene with Roy tearing up his lawn was removed from that edition.However, I wasn't as disappointed with that version as I am with this. Many of the scenes from the 1st SE have been moved off to the second DVD as deleted scenes. A bad choice in my opinion. However, those scenes that were missing in the SE from the original release are back in with some other new scenes plonked in as well. Still, it's a disappointment with the other scenes missing.But, the other features on the second DVD are great. But, I wish Columbia/TriStar would take notice of how James Cameron released T2 - The Ultimate Edition. In that release, you have the choice of 3 versions of the movie on the same DVD: The original theatrical release, the Special Edition which came out a few years later on VHS, and then a third version with more deleted scenes in addition to the SE version. I don't know why Columbia/TriStar/Spielberg couldn't have done the same for Close Encounters.The picture itself is great and the sound is excellent. Much better than the original release back in 1977, but of course, technology for sound has improved vastly since then, so it's not a surprise. Still, it's amazing how the sound can make a difference in how a movie is presented.To have this on DVD is a must. Now, if Spielberg would release the Indiana Jones movies and Lucas would release the 2nd trilogy of Star Wars as well on DVD, my sci-fi/action DVD collection would be almost complete.",1023926400,"06 13, 2002"

"Where to begin, where to begin.  First, Jeanette had three older brothers and a little sister.  Jeanette's sister, Catherine, died giving birth to a child, not as depicted in this film.  Second, Jeanette first heard the Voices in the garden by the house, then she saw a bright light.  The Voices identified themselves as St. Michael, St. Catherine, and St. Margaret.  Jeanette repeatedly tried to save English lives.The story of Jeanette (""Little Joan""), a 5'2"" teenager who led the armies of France inspired by Voices and was burned at the stake would make a marvelous movie or musical.  Whether she was a saint or delusional, the movie could balance the depiction and let the viewer decide.But what this movie does not capture and what needs to be captured is the pathos of this small, teenage girl abandoned by her country, surrounded by enemies, fighting for her life.Go read the trial transcripts and base the dialogue on them, not the ridiculous tripe served up in this Joan-bashing movie.",1463961600,"05 23, 2016"

"Richard Gere is the tough Chicago cop who goes to the Big Easy to track down the killer of his partner. This killer is a much feared hood in New Orleans named Losado. While down there Gere runs into Kim Basinger, a ""slave"" of Losado's, and he becomes determined to free her as well as kill Losado. This is all very typical thriller fare, although it can be pretty suspenseful at times--especially in the bayous and, of course, the big ending where Gere gets his man in a nail-biting shoot out and fire. But after you've seen this, ask yourself the next day how much you can remember. Note: There's a scene in the picture that's stolen directly from Hitchcock's ""The 39 Steps"": Gere and Basinger are handcuffed together as they make their escape through the swamps.",1111536000,"03 23, 2005"

"This is the first movie where Tom Hanks really began to show his depth. It was a film that required him to open with the comedic chops he's honed so well but then, because of the deepening of the film's story from comedy to drama, requested so much more of him. He ultimately delivers in spades.This is really a story about a son moving very fast in the fast lane of advertising. He's a pro and he loves what he does. He's also a personality that lives on charm and in the moment.  But when his parents separate after years of marriage, his life changes rapidly from no personal responsibilities to a multitude of them. It's also begs a question that rarely gets told well- how do sons and daughters deal with parents as life turns the tables and we suddenly start having to deal with listening to and taking care of them? The changing of roles and responsibilities. As the film unfolds, it presents those concerns with proper weight, depth, sadness, growth and understanding.Gary Marshall directed the film prior to his mega hit with Pretty Woman but I really think this is the better film of the two. He draws the best from Jackie Gleason, Eva Marie Saint and Beth Armstrong and Hector Alonzo- each lending a real ensemble cast feeling to the piece and although Tom Hanks shines- so do they.Jackie Gleason deserves special mention because he really plays a rather hard, sad man at the end of the road as a clothing salesman, and he digs deep, never lending anything false to how this man thinks, feels and operates. The exchanges between him and Hanks about how he was raised lend a real truth to the role.If you're looking for a film that has some humor and some depth of feeling in the same breath, this is an interesting evening's viewing.An underrated film that deserves a second look and a larger audience.",1155600000,"08 15, 2006"

"Before the show was sullied by the addition of Cheryl Ladd, Shelly Hack and Tanya Roberts, it was an unlikely example of both feminisim (women working together to save each other from abuse) and anti-feminism (the bad woman is still butch and grotesque).Featuring a very young Kim Bassinger, this episode is a classic for Charlie's Angels fans. Set approximately in the first half of the first season of the ABC series, it features flouncy hair, guns and empowered women. This time, the angels are going undercover in a corupt women's prison to save women from being the warden's call girls.Yes, the idea of a prison prostitution ring is designed to titilate the audience, but the fact that the Angels are resucing those women breaks from the traditional damsel in distress routine. Although critics blasted it and suggested that it was a cheesecake factory, it (unlike the modern counterpart, baywatch) is much less exploitative for women.This series is so much more, that is should be considered the path breaker for Buffy the Vampire Slayer which shows brains and beauty can coexist.",982972800,"02 24, 2001"

"I have to say I had higher hopes for this video; Sesame Street has such a wonderful stable of number clips, and I was hoping to see better ones.So, for the first time, I'm recommending the between-clip footage over the clips!  The opening song ""That's How The Numbers Go"" could easily become the numerical version of the ABC song; its jazzy and singable and goes all the way to twenty.  The setup is that Ernie stops by the Furry Arms Hotel to return a lost room key, where he shows bumbling hotel owners Humphrey and Ingrid that things (like room keys) can be organized with numbers.  I also like that this video isn't scrubbed clean of any conflict - the much-maligned bellhop, Benny the Bunny, is one of Kevin Clash's best characters, and he's terrific in this video; he and Ernie show how to return a sour face with a smile (and some innocent teasing!)Although there is one good clip - ""Martian Beauty #9,"" unfortunately, this doesn't include some of the ingenious and artistic number clips from Sesame Street past:  no bakers falling down stairs, no pinball machine, no counting marble machines.  Instead, you get the lukewarm ""#11 rap,"" which shows pictures of 11 things, and ""Five Jive with Elmo Hammer,"" which is already on too many Sesame Street videos as it is.

Great movie very funny John Wayne & Red Buttons are a real Hoot,1486598400,"02 9, 2017"
"This movie really borders on absurd. The play was simple, heart-felt and centered more on the goings on in the beauty salon. This movie is so overproduced that it diminishes the story and the performances.  Sally  Field gives a credible performance. Shirley McLaine and Olympia Dukakis  play their characters like a cartoon. And Dolly Parton proves she is really  sweet but can't act her way out of a paper bag.  As for Julia  Roberts...well she has screen presence, but she just can't act. Forget this  super-size cotton candy film.",964483200,"07 25, 2000"
"Wow!  I've had a laserdisc, a DVD, and now Blu Ray of this fun movie.  Yes, it's un-even and a little slow towards the end, but the music is great and van Dyke was never better.  My favorite part of the transfer is the audio.  Just beautiful.  Well-balanced between voices, effects and music.",1288742400,"11 3, 2010"

I have always loved this BIO of Patton. To bad he is not in the White House Now instead of what we have now.,1420329600,"01 4, 2015"

Take away the science fiction trappings and this is the tired old story of the younger brother who can never measure up to his older brother.  Who cares?,1392163200,"02 12, 2014"
