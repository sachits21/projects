Really Bad. I tried. I really tried but it's too bad to watch.,1471824000,"08 22, 2016",1.0,-1
"Despite some of the sideshow antics surrounding him, Mike Tyson's life has been very serious. His pre-boxing tale is one of a broken home, a violent youth, multiple incarcerations, and the loss of his mother and his mentor. His professional career was a success because he was the best violent man in a room full of violent men, and it was tainted by alleged nefarious actions by boxing promoter Don King. During that time, Tyson's personal life was plagued by a horrendous celebrity marriage to actress Robin Givens, in-the-ring controversy, out-of-the-ring violence, and a rape conviction with subsequent jail time. His post-boxing life includes the accidental death of one his children.Mike Tyson's life has been very serious. Yet the boxer-turned-celebrity, working from a script written by his current wife Kiki, avoids the opportunity to bare his soul and instead turns Undisputed Truth into Inconceivable Stand-Up.Have no illusions. This is not a case of a man making light of his past because he's learned to laugh in the face of adversity and face new challenges with a smile. This is schtick. Consider this gem of a line: ""The juvenile detention center was like Cheers: there everybody knew my name.""[ crickets ]Director Spike Lee stops short of adding rim shots to punchlines but something about the audience's reactions throughout the show smells funny. There is laughter where it should not be. I don't know if there is a laugh track, or if audience members were directed to laugh loud, or if audio levels were strategically manipulated. But something about much of the laughter rings false. And I don't think it's me. I've seen enough comedy in my life to understand what is meant to be funny even when it isn't funny to me. I understand that humor is as subjective as you can get. This isn't that.Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth is a difficult watch, a statement that goes beyond the schtick. Tyson, who by the time this was filmed had been through his material countless times, lacks any sense of storytelling timing or cadence. He hits marks and says lines the way someone who can't waltz makes his own matter worse because he's so busy counting 1-2-3, 1-2-3 in his headhe abandons any and all sense of natural action.There were interesting facts to be learned about Tyson and his life, but they whizzed by so quickly in an effort to get to the next joke or the next fact that there was no chance for Tyson to seems reflective or for the viewer to digest them.Tyson also gets winded very easily. I mention this not as a criticism of his physical condition (let's just say I'm no role model), but rather because he is speaking to an audience. After he physically exerts himself (mimicking old boxing moves, for example), he is trying to continue his story through panting breath, which makes him that much more difficult to understand.I lay as much of this at Spike Lee's feet as I do Tyson's. A director is responsible for controlling the actions of his performers. Here, Lee just lets Tyson ramble to whatever words Kiki has put on paper. This includes an incomprehensible 13-minute stretch focused on a story about Mitch Green, a boxer who Tyson defeated in the ring and also had a physical altercation with in the streets. Thirteen minutes! Mitch Green, who is, at best, a footnote in Tyson's history, gets more story time15% of the entire show, by the waythan any other part of Tyson's life. It is stupefying and frustrating and ultimately disappointing.The 1.78:1 anamorphic presentation is perfectly clear, although there is very little to spotlight with a one-man stage show. It captures the lighting well and when the camera cuts to audience members, their shadowy images are clear as well. The mix of Tyson and the crowd heard through the Dolby 5.1 is balanced nicely, and the film's soundtrack, which features songs from artists ranging from Nat King Cole to RUN-DMC, sounds good.In addition to the digital copy, there is only one extra, a featurette titled ""Conversations."" This is nothing more than HBO's 2-1/2 minute promo, where ""conversations"" are actually ""soundbites"" from Tyson, Lee, and others involved in the project.Michael Nazarewycz, VERDICTRead the full review at dvdverdict.com",1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2.0,-1

"Reeves seemed to be on depressants the entire movie--the hostages on the bus were far more entertaining and talented than he ever was in this film.  I'm still aghast at how utterly terrible Reeves' acting was.  It defies all comparison, explanation, and comprehension.I felt immensely sorry for Bullock, having to kiss him and all.

"This three episode drama (180 minutes) was disappointing. Expecting valid continuing story, extended insight into Elizabeth and Darcy.Wrong!The names are the same. However, the ideas, personality, reactions, premises do not match Jane Austins characters.Elizabeth Bennetts cool, incisive intelligence has disappeared. Darcys principled, serious, determined code has deteriorated into selfish insecurity.What a loss!Oddly, the only character continuing true was Elizabeths scatterbrained sister. Self-centered to the core, horrible judgement, phony in everything, yep, she is the same.Why can/does author so vividly present this silly, failure of a person and so faint an outline of an accomplished life?Well . . . seems the writer just cannot/willnot admit to Jane Austins portrayal of genuine, sincere, real principled character.This story almost seems more a character assassination than a murder mystery.Death comes to pemberly might really refer to the murder of the people in Jane Austins novel.The mystery, trial, verdict didn't catch my interest. Slow and poorly developed.The three hour bbc Pride and Prejudice video is fantastic.This one is clearly not Jane Austin!",1524096000,"04 19, 2018",2.0,-1
"This is a classic. In my opinion it is not slapstick, as some have said. A lot of the humor is more subtle, as in the opening when Mr. Hulot enters the hotel, the wind blows through the lobby area and one lady is pouring tea into a cup farther away. Also, the sound that the door makes as it swings back and forth when someone passes through it is genius. If you are looking for sitcom humor, this is not the movie for you. However, if you like subtle humor with some very funny moments...enjoy.Amazon's delivery was on schedule, and the DVD was in excellent condition.",1414454400,"10 28, 2014",5.0,1
"I knew I was in trouble when the Texas Ranger said Indians are ""just misunderstood."" The rest of the movie was the typical PC take with bad white Christians and good Mexicans and Indians.

"Took me by complete and utter dismay this. I thought it would fall flat on its knees but it did not and I'm glad I caught it. Most recent remakes of 80s movies are ugly roadkills so you can't actually blame me for thinking so, alright? Remember 'The A Team'? Anyway, the laughs here come hard and fast which is just the way I like my comedy. And my women. Hah. Just a little joke there. Awkward? Okay I'll move right along. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill play two police officers who fumble more than they rumble. They are taken off the streets and sent to a high school where they are tasked with infiltrating a drug dealing gang. The humor when these two become students is priceless, with plenty of laugh-out-loud hijinks and slapstick. It helps that the two leads are charming too. The story has very little to do with the 80s TV series and the leads are never as cool here as Johnny Depp was when he did the series. In fact, Tatum and Hill are downright silly which I think probably helped the movie considerably because it is hard to top Depp's coolness in the series (back then he was the bomb. Well at least he wasn't wearing pink like Don Johnson in 'Miami Vice'!). Enjoy.",1400544000,"05 20, 2014",3.0,0
"The movie oozes with adolescent immaturity from the opening scenes until the final credits. A successful film that degrades to the inane starts out with something realistic and takes the descent in steps. This one starts with a guy taking a nude blowup doll (while inflated) on a plane.  While the film idea was great, especially the ending, the execution was awful. Poor direction and script. Worth avoiding if you are over 18.F-bomb, lap dancing and groping, less nudity than expected, crude humor.",1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2.0,-1
"I sat down to watch this expecting to mock it for being wooden and mawkish, but instead of laughing at it, I found it to be better than I expected, so I'm inclined to review it fairly positively.You can't escape the fact, though, that it really is simply a vehicle for Liberace, and at 115 minutes long, it outstays its welcome. The extra bloat is all down to prolonged sequences of Liberace playing the piano, which naturally are there to showcase his talent but they really grind the pace of the film to a halt. The story is uncomplicated: Liberace plays a pianist who suddenly loses his hearing which changes his life in more ways than expected.Although Liberace does not have much range as an actor, he does impart some sense of emotion as his life changes. Not a lot, but some. And with him are some more seasoned actors who all acquit themselves fairly well. It's a shame that the story did focus on the plot more than the piano playing, although to see it for the story one could always watch ""The Man Who Played God"", an earlier film that this is a remake of.So basically if you like Liberace as a performer, you could enjoy this. Even I, while getting bored during most of the lengthy concert sequences, did enjoy his ""Boogie-Woogie"" set piece, and I could see how his fans found him to be an entertaining performer. But for anyone watching for the story, it's too melodramatic and preachy in too many places to really draw you in.Probably more of a curiosity piece than anything else, but as I said at the start of the review, it is not a total failure, and actually does stand up as moderately entertaining piece of schmaltz. I was able to buy the UK Region 2 DVD which is a lot less expensive than the Amazon.com far eastern import, although the UK Orbit Media DVD is not great quality, it's in full screen and with faded colours and a blurry image. However it is cheap!Comment",1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2.0,-1

"Note: This review may contains spoilers--'Invictus' is designed to be a 'feel-good' movie about relationships between blacks and whites. The setting is South Africa beginning with the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in 1990 and his subsequent ascent to the South African presidency a short time later. Morgan Freeman does a great job in 'channeling' the great man and you really feel as if you're watching Mandela himself. When the Oscars come up, Freeman has a very good shot at copping the Oscar for Best Actor.Clint Eastwood's strategy is to depict Nelson Mandela's program for racial reconciliation through the narrow prism of International Rugby. While there are a few interesting glimpses of Mandela interacting with his main assistant and some of his counselors, little of his personal life is shown (there is a brief scene where he's depicted as being alienated from his daughter who regards him as something of a sell-out). By the second half, Mandela is reduced to being basically a cheerleader for the South African Rugby team. Still, the sheer humanity of Mandela is always at the forefront, with his emphasis on forgiveness.I liked the first half of Invictus better than the second. There's a good scene where Mandela tries to persuade a group of his constituents (a Sports Federation) not to disenfranchise the rugby team. Mandela, in Christ-like fashion, urges the crowd to 'turn the other cheek' and support the team despite their identification of the white players with the apartheid era. Despite their initial rejection, blacks in South Africa gradually come to root for the team. One way they're won over is after Mandela asks the team to tour the shanty towns and introduce rugby to poor black children. It helps that there's one black player on the team who becomes a national figure. But when Mandela visits the team before a big game and congratulates each player individually, he's sending a signal that he's for whites as much as blacks. And the white players (who are initially depicted as being quite alienated and angry after Mandela becomes President) gradually soften up too: in one poignant scene, they go on a tour of the prison where Mandela was held for 27 years. Later they're not afraid to sing the new South African anthem with their black countrymen.Less successful are the scenes involving Mandela's bodyguards. The tension between the black and white bodyguards at the beginning is quite understandable. But virtually none of the characters are ever fleshed out. It takes a team victory in the Rugby World Cup to get them all hugging one another. But the camaraderie seems quite superficial. One wonders if everyone will be so touchy-feeley once all the excitement has worn off.Invictus completely loses steam in the second half. There's virtually no suspense since the film's outcome is a forgone conclusion. What's worse is that the idea of an antagonist is lost as the film plods along. The tension between blacks and whites is palpable at the beginning but as the focus shifts to the rugby team itself, where is the conflict? Good movies have a moment where the protagonist faces a moment of crisis leading to a 'dark moment of the soul'. The best Invictus offers us is when Mandela collapses after being overworked. It's not enough!The awkwardness of the entire screenplay is embodied in the relationship between the team captain, Francois Pienaar, played by Matt Damon and Mandela. They have one scene together when Mandela invites Pinaar to tea. We find out next to nothing about Pienaar but maybe that's because there's not a lot to find out. Damon runs around a lot on the field but only briefly confronts his teammates who are initially reluctant to embrace Mandela's plan for reconciliation. Again, where is the conflict?As an American who is unfamiliar with the rules of rugby, I was bored watching scene after scene of grown men groping one another without protective equipment. Since Eastwood really had no exciting climax to offer, he pads the last twenty minutes of the film with what I would term an extended 'highlight reel'. For rugby aficionados, this might prove to be orgasmic. As for ignorant Americans such as myself, I never thought I'd be desperate to tune into next Sunday's football game so quickly.Some have claimed that Invictus is just another film about race relations from the white man's perspective. Maybe so but I prefer to view it as primarily a mediocre sports film. On the plus side, if one wishes to feel good without thinking too hard, then one can indulge oneself in this rather superficial glimpse of racial harmony. While Invictus fails in the drama department, Morgan Freeman's performance as the great and inspiring Mandela will make you look at race relations from the glass being half full and not half empty.",1261699200,"12 25, 2009",2.0,-1
"I don't really fit into either category, but I have  done a lot of reading of military history over the last few years, especially the Russian-German conflict of WWII.Eventually, I started thinking about how the Nazis came to power. Buying this DVD seemed like buying a record of a small but important piece of history.I got this DVD at the same time as Riefenstahl's ""Triumph of the Will"" just to see for myself the differences.And there are many.In ""Victory of Faith"", Ernst Rohm is featured almost as prominently as Adolph Hitler himself, which shows just how powerful he was within the Nazi Party in 1933 as head of the SA - he was nearly equal to Hitler. A number of the early Nazi Party bigwigs are featured prominently as well.  As mentioned by other reviewers, the familiar Nazis of WWII - Himmler, Goebbels, and even Goring - make only brief appearances in this movie.""Victory of Faith"" is a roughly and simply made documentary of the rough and simple early Nazi Party, with lots of the usual ground-level shots, simple close-ups of key Nazis giving speeches, and scenes of Nazi Party members marching and camping out while carrying on with the 1933 Nazi Party Congress. The ordinary, every-day life activities of these proto-Nazi storm troopers in their campgrounds are depicted with a down-to-earth humanizing touch. By the time of ""Triumph of the Will"", these same Nazi SS and SA storm troopers will be put on a pedestal and glorified as Aryan gods.The contents of this DVD are fragmented into several parts, and my copy of the DVD did not move smoothly from one section to the next. Even accounting for this problem, the fragmented pieces of this film still do not fit together smoothly.And so this DVD is basically just the raw footage of what remains of the movie. If you don't speak or read German, the English subtitles provide very little information about what is going on in this movie.For most WWII buffs, the usual top Nazis of the WWII era are readily recognizable, but the problem is that this DVD is about the early Nazi Party, which was led by people who would be replaced and then doomed to death and/or obscurity later on. Without any help from the DVD, one has to research some of the early history of the Nazi Party to find out who is who in this movie.The only one of the obscure proto-Nazis in this movie that I was able to successfully figure out was Baldur Schirach, who had just been made the head of the Hitler Youth. He is featured very prominently giving speeches and leading the Hitler Youth. In a touch of irony, at the Nuremburg trials post-WWII, he would be one of only two Nazis to renounce Hitler (Speer was the other).There is much in the way of foreshadowing of things to come in ""Victory of Faith"". One can already spot the stylishly evil black uniforms of the SS, which Himmler had commissioned only the year before from fashion designer Hugo Boss, yet another of his gradual steps to distinguish his SS from Rohm's SA. However, in this film, the black-uniforms of the SS stay entirely in the background, and they are just that, uniforms. In ""Triumph of the Will"", the SS uniform is framed front and center, and reaches the full heights of its powerfully evil symbolism.Himmler and the black-uniformed SS would be the instruments for Hitler to gain complete control of the Nazi Party. Less than a year after ""Victory of Faith"" was made, Ernst Rohm would be executed by Himmler's SS.And so ""Triumph of the Will"", Riefenstahl's documentary of the subsequent Nazi Party Congress of 1934, is mainly about the ascension to power of the winners of that internal power struggle. The biggest winner was undoubtedly Heinrich Himmler. In ""Victory of Faith"", Himmler barely makes an appearance as one of Hitler's SS guards; in ""Triumph of the Will"", he is powerfully depicted at Hitler's side throughout key symbolic moments.With an unlimited budget, we thus get to see the full stylishness of Riefenstahl's pioneering film techniques in ""Triumph of the Will"".Hitler's speeches in ""Triumph of the Will"" concentrate heavily on justifying the massive blood purge within the Nazi Party that had just occurred. If one simply ignores all the propaganda bombast and Norse mythology - Nazi symbolism, ""Triumph of the Will"" fundamentally only shows that the main purpose of the 1934 Nazi Party Congress was to have the large numbers of defeated SA men publicly demonstrate their fealty to the new unquestioned boss of the Nazis, Adolph Hitler, and to showcase the new group of Hitler loyalists who had taken over the Party.All in all, ""Victory of Faith"" provides an interesting glimpse into a key moment in history - that period of time right before the Nazi Party transformed itself into the cohesive, Hitler-centric, evil force that would beget WWII.Unfortunately, this DVD is pretty much a do-it-yourself history project, with just segments of the raw footage of that moment.",1164758400,"11 29, 2006",2.0,-1
"The first in this series was definitely the best.  Of all I think the second was the worst, but it is a close running between the third and second.

"...and dance they do! And they do it very, very well.4.5 stars for the jaw dropping moves these kids are able to do but a mere 2 stars for everything else, so let's round that to 3 stars shall we.Though it's been said over and over again about other movies of this ilk, there has to be more to a movie than the dancing and as far as Step Up 2 the Streets goes, the other stuff just doesn't really cut it.The film chronicles - did I say chronicles? - sorry, no, this movie doesn't chronicle anything, it's about a young street dancer named Andie (Briana Evigan). She's beautiful, out of this world talented and certainly doesn't want to be shipped off to Texas which is where she's headed if she doesn't stop getting into trouble.Andie gets accepted into the elite Maryland School of the Arts (MSA) where she attempts to widen her dancing scope to more classical styles. Her street dancing crew the 4-1-0 - all but one of whom does not know Andie is now enrolled in the school - become sick and tired of the excuses she gives as to why she isn't able to attend practice with them and they eventually kick her out of the crew.This is where I find the character flaws in the movie to be really apparent...these kids are obviously in their late teens and 20s, however they spend all day dancing in the streets, Have they no jobs?? No responsibilities?? How do they pay for the cost of living? Don't they even take a break to make some deals or turn some tricks?? It's not just that they are sooo devoted to dancing and preparing for a dance battle called ""The Streets"", the writers make it seem like they genuinely solely exist to practice their dancing 24-7. No one has to go home because their baby-mama is always nagging, no one has goals or dreams, their only purpose in the film is to dance...and still with all that practice they still don't have what it takes.Fortunately, all these annoyances are seasoned with superbly choreographed and exceptionally performed dance numbers that make the knot in my forehead relax until the plot gets back underway.Andie decides to put together her own crew made up of static, clich outcast kids that go to MSA. There's the Asian girl who thinks she's ""down"" but you can't understand a word she says, the tall-loner girl no one hangs out with, a guy who's supposed to be the nerdy guy, but this isn't really developed, a few others not worth mentioning and the other main character, Chase Collins (Robert Hoffman).When we first hear of Chase, we are immediately led to believe that he is MSA royalty but living in the shadow of his older, more talented MSA faculty brother and also that his dancing skills have given him a sense of entitlement making him something of a playa with the ladies. This would be all well and good, for Chase would be a well-developed character and even have opportunities for growth as he tries to redeem himself from his philandering ways and woo our heroine Andie. However, as soon as we get to know Chase, he's not like this at all, in fact none of the earlier descriptions of him are mentioned again or developed at all - he's just a regular boring guy with nothing extraordinarily good or bad about him. But, like everyone else in the film, he's great looking...and man, can he dance!Alright, so the ""plot"" eventually brings us to the ultimate street battle called, no less, ""The Streets"" between the new crew and the old crew in a rain-soaked climax I won't ruin it for you (really, if you have to ask who wins you just don't get how formulaic this film is). This dance-off is well worth the wait as the choreography is spot-on. The scene could not have been shot with more skill, you can see how fluid the dancing is, nothing is chopped up which leaves the viewer in awe at how many laws of physics are shattered by the moves these kids are able to do!Another thing worth mentioning is the supposed-nerdy kid named Moose (newcomer Adam G. Sevani) who befriends Andie at MSA, he's a kid who we see is stuck in the wrong major once we see his entertaining freestyle moves. He makes the most of the character given him and probably saves the story that falls flat in between dance numbers. Maybe, just maybe, one day he'll be the Jason Biggs of a new generation.In summary, don't get me wrong, when I left the theater I was smiling and wishing I had those mad skills. You just have to know what to expect before you see the movie or you may wind up being too disappointed to really appreciate how superb the dancing is. Thus, if dancing is your thing, do lower your expectations as regards plot and characterization and do cop this disc and you too will be wowed and blown away by the dancing as these kids Step up 2 The Streets.",1209945600,"05 5, 2008",3.0,0
"If I were to take a trip back to my childhood, the aptly-named ""Moonwalker"", the brainchild of Michael Jackson, would be one of the prominent stops. Even back when I wasn't necessarily an MJ fan (I am now), this movie captured my imagination. Rather than a whole, cohesive movie, it's a collection of mini-films, for the most part well-woven together. The first part is a performance of ""Man in the Mirror"". The second is a retrospective on Michael Jackson's career, with clips from his music videos and performances from his early career to his ""Bad"" days (which is the era when the movie was made, and it shows). The third is a re-enactment of the ""Bad"" video by a younger counterpart of the cast. The fourth part is a mini-movie which features Michael Jackson escaping from maniacal fans and press by racing a motorcycle as a rabbit-man and eventually doing a dance duel with him (you really need to see it to believe it). The fifth is a video for ""Leave Me Alone"", and the sixth and final part is a noir/sci-fi film where Michael and three young kids on the streets who have befriended him try to escape a drug lord (Joe Pesci) who wants Michael's head after the latter discovers his plans to get all kids addicted to drugs.""Moonwalker"" never made it to theatres in the US (it did, however, in Europe and South America), but that didn't stop the VHS release to be sold in over 800,000 copies within a year of the movie's release. It is a truly engrossing trip through the imagination of the legendary musician/entertainer. While many musicians have tried their hands at filmmaking and only succeeded at showing that they have no talent at it, Michael Jackson surprises. Not only does he show that he has as much feel for staging and visual storytelling as he has for music, he manages to make this movie his own, weaving into both the collage and story some truly imaginative moments.Take the midway point, where we sort of hit the ""present"". The ""Bad"" video is reenacted by younger actors, in a truly hilarious but nonetheless competent spectacle. After that, Michael Jackson emerges onto the 'streets' of Hollywood and is hounded by an assortment of stark-raving-mad, claymated fans and press. An attempt by a humoured Michael to escape his chasers ensues, but as he finds out, trying to hide out in Hollywood studios (especially when you're Michael Jackson) is about as easy as hiding the punch at a banquet.But his way out of this situation is possibly my favourite part of the movie. Disguising himself as a leather-clad rabbit man, he manages to escape the studios on a bicycle, which transforms into a motorcycle. At this point ""Speed Demon"" kicks in as the rabbit-man drives at breakneck speed down the highway, ocean and sky. And still the relentless fans and media are hot on Michael's tail, his disguise not fooling them. This all makes up a truly stunning piece of claymation, both excellently-paced and delicious to behold. Driving out into the desert, Michael takes off his disguise only to have the rabbit disguise reanimate itself, and the two do the best dance duel I've ever seen. It's especially stunning to see the claymated rabbit dance like MJ, and Will Vinton and co (who were responsible for the claymation segment, while Michael himself is live-action) truly deserve an applause for this as well as Michael.Following is the video for ""Leave Me Alone"", a truly imaginative, satirical portrait of the mass hysteria the media attribute to Michael. Michael humorously visualises this as an amusement park constructed on top of him, while a miniature version of him goes through a has-to-be-seen-to-be-believed tour, frequented by lots of dogs in suits. This video may feel like a filler but its imagination and vision more than make up for it.This is when the 'movie' itself begins. My favourite part is when Michael steps into a 30s-style club and ""Smooth Criminal"" kicks in, resulting in a truly artistic music-video sequence, climaxing in the middle, when the music dies and the club-goers chant, for almost a minute, before the music kicks back in. I won't spoil the rest of the movie for you, but these are my favourite parts.If you are a Michael Jackson fan then this belongs in your collection for sure. Whether or not you are a fan, if you want to see a really imaginative, creative journey through Michael Jackons's imagination, I can also recommend this. One thing is for sure; the tagline couldn't be more correct. This truly IS a movie like no other.",1218585600,"08 13, 2008",5.0,1
"The following response to Calvary contains a spoiler, but you might thank me for it.Only rarely have I felt betrayed by a writer/director, but John Michael McDonough is now at the top of that short list. The outstanding acting and production values of Calvary are ultimately put in the service of a deeply cynical conclusion. I mean what else would one call killing off the one caring human being in the whole film, and, in a cheap imitation of a horror flick, showing blood squirting out of the back of his head? And then theres the priests daughter smiling sweetly at her fathers killerwhat is one to make of that?  Unlike the death and resurrection of Gods son, the death of the priest in this film serves no redemptive purpose whatsoever.

"I went into this with no more info than the Amazon description. My 3 might be a bit deceptive, it was an enjoyable family movie with no shoot'em up, fung-fu, swearing, and not even many dirty looks much less anything dirty unless you count the muddy kid near the start.The movie starts with a couple that can't have a baby hearing the news from the doctors that having kids is just not going to happen. On that sad new the couple decide to write down the qualities their kid would have if they had one and the movie magic begins. The movie is told after the fact as a story to child adoption case workers and the couple trying to explain their qualifications for adoption.This is sort of Kyle XY & Phenomenon meets Richie Cunningham, and Happy Days is what sticks, in fact, I might say watching this is like 3-4 episodes of Happy Days the TV show back-to-back.The movie does not even attempt to tie up loose ends, tackle obvious questions, like how does an 8 year old show up and no one questions where he came from, they just sort of glaze over that part.So in the end this is a feel good movie that will be on the Hallmark Channel in a short while, for most I would say wait for the TV movie to come out, however, if you are looking for a break from the kill everything in sight movies, just want to relax with the family and see an enjoyable albiet sappy flick, this is a good choice.",1358899200,"01 23, 2013",3.0,0

"As a movie in it's general sense, Beat Street is not a great film. It's just OK.

"National Geographic, Beyond the Movie Series has done a commendable job analyizing and comparing JRR Tolkien classic fantasy world of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy using Peter Jacksons passion & Tolkien detailed epic book to film Part I: The Fellowship of the Ring to our worlds past geography.This documentation brings up some interesting questions regarding Tolkiens fantasy world and his real life experiences.  JRR Tolkien was a WWI veteran, Oxford Scholar, Professor of Languages and English Legends.  He discovered that England was robbed of their early legends & history through 5th & 6th century invasions.  Tolkien decided to re-create an entire world including an Elven Language (both written & spoken) which revolved around England & its mystical past using ancient castles & landmarks as references.National Geographic explains Tolkiens amazing world of Middle Earth vs our world, the struggle between good & evil, the familiarity of the places, heroes & villains, and the parallel challenges in our world!  Using Peter Jacksons film clips adds to this fascinating epic story tremendously.  Pure entertainment & very informative.  A great addition to the ""Lord of the Rings"" DVD library.This DVD is a Full Screen presentation, approximately 60 minutes with no extras except National Geographic ads.

"Carl Allen (Carrey), a divorced, borderline reclusive couch potato says, ""No"" to everything.  His negativity naturally steered him towards the divorce, his general malaise, and his work as a loan manager.  When his friend Nick (John Michael Higgins) convinces him to attend a cult-like `Yes' seminar from Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp), his life soon changes.Following the yes-mantra in every way, Carl soon meets Allison (Zooey Deschanel), who allows spontaneity and bizarre creativity to rule her life.  She is think outside the box personified, and, more importantly, different than the pre-vow Carl in every way.  Together they attack life and cross off a checklist that looks stolen from an insane person's bucket list.  Along the way, Carl predictably learns that in order to truly enjoy life, and another person, one must be open to new experiences and take life as it comes.  This is right up my philosophical alley, challenging oneself, breaking through barriers, and being able to look back in your later years with admiration.  The result is silly, typical Jim Carrey, with just enough laughs to make it enjoyable.  I especially enjoyed the name of the alternative band led by Allison: Munchausen by Proxy.  That's hilarious.  However, there are two major problems with this movie.First, and not as significant, the cross-generational implied sex scene between Carl and his geriatric neighbor is enough to make a billygoat puke.  It's unnecessarily gross, and I've been less appalled by the Saw series.  Secondly, however, is the nave nature with which Carl embraces the ""say yes to everything""-culture.  After giving a bum a ride and allowing him to run down his cell battery, Carl drops the guy off in a dark, remote park and gives him a wad of cash.  Murders start out this way.  Imagine if he had said yes to other situations that could have been presented:-Seriously, do you want to go in that meth house?-Don't worry about protection; let's go au natural.  OK?-Can I tell you what it is after you eat it?-I know that hitchhiker has a bloody shirt and an ear-necklace, but I feel good about him because his sign says he's a vet.  Want to pick him up?There's promise to the premise, but just like everything in life, there are shades of gray.Overall, Carrey is pretty funny, especially during the Nebraska football scene, but I feel like the co-stars stole the show.  Zooey Deschanel is cute, and off-beat enough to make the character believable.  Other than Maggie Gyllenhall, I can't think of another actress who could have believably pulled it off.  Stamp is convincing as the self-help guru Bundley - his brood is like a snake-swinging church.  Higgins is hilarious as a cross between an insane man and a liberated free-thinker.  The true scene-stealer, however, is Rhys Darby as Norman; his costume parties (Harry Potter and 300) are hilarious, and his awkward Britishness (?) fits perfectly into the niche necessary for plot development.Even though my single word feeling about this movie is, ""Meh,"" I happily say ""Yes"" and recommend it if for no other reason than to see Jim Carrey return to his comedic roots abandoned after Me, Myself, and Irene.",1241222400,"05 2, 2009",3.0,0

"Wallace and Gromit: A Matter of Loaf and Death / B001OC6RZAMy family and I are long-time lovers of ""Wallace and Gromit"", but we just hated ""Loaf and Death"". Someone on the production team apparently felt that W&G needed a 'dark and edgy' upgrade to appeal to a wider demographic, so ""Loaf and Death"" was created with all the basic plot points of ""Close Shave"", but with the violence and insanity ramped up to 11, and with all the charm sucked out with nary a backward glance.""Close Shave"" was fun and amusing because, despite the potentially dark subject matter of sheep being stolen in a nefarious plot to grind them into dog meat, (a) nobody ever got seriously hurt (including the villain, due to a timely Made of Steel revelation), and (b) the plot was so over-the-top amusing, with hilarious moments that burned indelibly into the memory: most memorably the ""organized"" motorcycle riding sheep.""Loaf or Death"" has none of those amusing moments, despite a few throw-away jokes. The story is immediately darker than ""Close Shave"", as human bakers in the area have been murdered in a recent crime spree. The lady of the hour, Wallace's new love, is of course the culprit - and the movie makes no bones about the fact that she is incredibly insane (filling her bedroom with wooden clothes models, wearing the baker hats of her dead lovers) and that she is abusing her French poodle. Yes, you read that right - the ""Shaun the Sheep"" of this movie is a pretty girl poodle who is openly abused by her mistress - even being hit so hard with a shovel that she leaves a cartoon 'outline' in the shovel. Ha, ha, ha, I'm not laughing. In yet another ""funny"" moment, Wallace's insane fiance bites her own arm in order to incriminate Gromit - the scene is way more disturbing than it sounds.Although ""Loaf and Death"" retains the iconic W&G look, the feel is that of a series that has been handed over to a brand new team of writers and developers. Even W&G have been flanderized - Wallace's signature neglect and misunderstanding of Gromit has blossomed into outright abuse of his position as 'master', such as when Wallace decides not to go out in the rain on an errand and 'cunningly' sends Gromit instead. This sort of character change really undermines the entire relationship between the two main characters - as Wallace becomes less of an innocent dupe in need of defending and just another human-who-won't-see-Gromit-as-an-equal, and therefore deserving of their fate.I would not recommend this new featurette.

"Viewers are no strangers to this kind of flick. The romanticizing of a clever heist man with the dogged detective who cannot quite seem to bring him in. Then there's the big job that might, or might not succeed that will either let our hero retire or send him to jail. This is not one of the better outings.Here's the scoop. Kevin Spacey plays Michael Lynch, a Dubliner who is clever and kind. He pulls off his jobs and no one gets hurt. He's married (to Linda Fiorentino) with kids but also has a loving relationship with his sister in law. His wife is fine with that. Detective Noel Quigley (Stephen Dillane) has arrested Lynch and gotten him into court but Lynch always prevails. Now Lynch is after the big score involving a highly priced piece of art. Will he win the day or land in jail?This is a fun enough romp. I like Spacey and he has a notable crew with veterans Peter Mullen, David Hayman and Colin Farrel. This must have been early in Farrel's career as he is little more than window dressing. I suppose it is curious that two of the main characters, Spacey and Fiorentino are from the states. I guess the Weinstein boys had their sights set across the pond. Anyway...this is just Okay. A bit diverting I suppose but it needed to be more clever and needed more tension. I never doubted the outcome. And since this has been done before that is something the writer/producers/director should have attended to. And something happens in the climax (that the outcome relies on 100 %) and so iffy I cringed that it was included at all.Like I said. It's watchable and you like the characters well enough.

Frankie Avalon and Dwayne Hickman each made better teen films, and though co-star Vincent price is a hoot and Susan Hart is hot, the screenplay is a dud. Worse yet, the script's original musical bent was trimmed down to only the terrific Guy Hemric/Jerry Styner-penned theme song.

Like any number of 1960s spy films - dramas and comedies - there's a lot of opportunity to pick out things Mike Myers poached for his Austin Powers series, not least of which are the gold bikini clad fembots. Lots of slapstick from the entire cast (which includes character actor Jack Mullaney), and some entertainingly bad green screen work in which Avalon and Hickman ride a motorbike amongst what seem to be gigantic trucks and cars. Keep your eye peeled for cameos from several AIP Beach Party stars. The original Beach Party films are better entertainment (particularly for their musical content) and better mid-60s spy spoofs can be found, but if you've exhausted both genres, see this one for completeness. Nice crisp print, but the original trailer is the only extra. [2009 hyperbolium dot com]",1246665600,"07 4, 2009",3.0,0

"This film is based on the book by Nikolai Gogol, and as such has stuck to the patriotic theme that he adopted for reasons of conformity at the time. That being said I decided to judge it as a film in its' own right. It tells the story of the legendary Taras Bulba who, in the 16th Century took on the enemies of the Cossacks with his two sons.They, his sons,  were first sent to be trained by the monks and returned as men, but not Cossacks so he takes them off to the Cossack `finishing school', where he discovers that a shameful truce has been signed by the `ataman' a spiritual and de facto leader, with the Sultan (his enemy). Taras then orchestrates an embarrassing show down to get him removed and replaced by someone with more war like tendencies. Just as he has the mob whipped up into a frenzy of Islamophobia, some of his comrades turn up with news that all of his men, livestock and family have been murdered by the invading Poles, who are in collusion with the Tartars, Roman Catholics and worst of all Jews. So we have a smorgasbord of hatred and retribution brewing up. First thing is a Jewish pogrom, but Taras intervenes, and then takes them all to fight the Poles.His youngest son has also fallen for the daughter Elizabeta, of the Tartars -she looks a bit like Britney Spears (with hair that is). She is with her father who is sheltering with the Polish garrison. What follows is a tale of Shakespearian tragedy. Taras faces one battle after another. Speaking of which, there are lots of battles and the siege scenes are excellent, with little or no CGI as far as I could tell. There is masses of gore and proper hand to hand fighting. Bogdan Stupka as Bulba is a tour de force, but director Vladimir Bortko manages to illicit strong performances from all those concernd. There is a big however, and that is when they come to some of their `am dram' deaths and start wailing on about how great Mother Russia is, before finally expiring. One would have been tolerable but after the third it gets to be a bit wearisome, and not in the slightest bit believable. That is the movies downfall it has sacrificed cod propaganda and sentimentality for even a veneer of authenticity.It is in Russian and Polish with English sub titles, when they speak Polish it is translated verbatim into Russian! Still I did ruddy well enjoy this film and as it is over two hours long, that has done well to keep my attention, the costumes are excellent, the music is great and the cast of thousands was very much appreciated, but I have to judge on the whole package, so not quite a four star offering, but very close indeed.",1316304000,"09 18, 2011",3.0,0

This was very nostalgic as I was a 9-year veteran of the Strategic Air Command.  The movie was very accurate in the mood of Air Force people when an ORI (Operational Readiness Inspection) came to town.  This inspection was a 'make-or-break' situation for leadership and was a great depiction of what happened in real life.  Can't say enough about Rock Hudson's portrayal as the wing commander.  One of the neat little side points for me is that one of the extras in the movie who portrayed an aircraft mechanic was an authentic Air Force CMSgt - I worked for him in a later assignment and he often was referred to as 'the movie star'.  A good movie that I will watch again.  I'm waiting now for arrival of 'Strategic Air Command' with Jimmy Stewart and then I'll be in SAC-heaven.

"This disc is, in effect, the broadcast programme from the Proms as broadcast by the BBC but with an important modification.The musical side of the issue is largely very good but with some major reservations as follows. There are four Coronation Anthems and these were all performed at this concert. However on the disc the second of the anthems can only be accessed as a `bonus'. Even worse, it is only available in stereo and the imaging is extremely poor. The drop in technical standard is startling and its relegation to 'bonus' status suggests that the producers realise that it is simply not good enough for the main program.The organ concerto is performed in a very strange way indeed with hesitations and stops in the flow of the solo part which is totally disruptive in its effect. Why this is performed in this way is not explained but it sounds like a beginner who keeps losing their place and stopping before continuing. Perhaps this is supposed to suggest improvisation. It doesn't work. Other reviewers dislike this for the same reasons so beware.Carolyn Sampson is so good as to be almost worth the price of the disc alone. Her `Myself I shall adore' aided with the prop of a hand mirror is unforgettably amusing and I am sure would have delighted Handel who was well known to have had a mischievous sense of humour.Unfortunately all of the above comes with ebullient contributions from the announcer between every single item. This may be OK for a television broadcast but is insufferable for repeat viewing. Furthermore the sound level for this extreme level of enthusiasm is at a higher decibel level than the music as the announcer raises her voice to be heard over the audience in the hall. Surely this could have been relegated to that of a `bonus' feature? As it stands this is yet another disincentive for considering a purchase of this disc.So in summary -  5 stars for Carolyn Sampson and 3 of the anthems, 2 stars for the concerto, no stars for the `bonus' 2nd anthem and, if it were possible, minus stars for imposed announcer commentary and awful recording quality of the bonus anthem. All my reservations are mentioned by other reviewers so not just a rogue review here. I would advise considerable caution before purchasing this disc.This could have been so good. What a pity. This is a heavily compromised issue therefore, and in my opinion is not worth more than two stars. There are simply too many flaws in the production coupled with a questionable approach to the concerto.",1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2.0,-1

"This is one of the strangest looking films I can remember. The sets make this film look like a biblical soap opera gone futuristic. I am not sure if this was director Victor Saville's intent or not. Filmed in CinemaScope by William V. Skall, it just looks so offbeat. In fact, Skall was nominated for an Academy Award for his Color Cinematography on this film. Based on the novel by Thomas Costain, it deals with the trials and tribulations of a Greek craftsman, portrayed by a very young Paul Newman, who designed the cup used at the Last Supper. The cast includes voluptuous Virginia Mayo, a demented looking Jack Palance, Pier Angeli, Joseph Wiseman, Natalie Wood, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene and Alexander Scourby. Faring best is Jack Palance giving a cryptic performance as a master of illusions. Franz Waxman's Academy Award nominated score is excellent, outdoing the script and most of the performances. This was director Victor Saville's second to last film. It is a curious and interesting film, which certainly follows a different path.

"The Man fromt's interesting enough Snowy River is an Australian effort that came out in 1982.  It's no Shane or even Jeremiah Johnson, but it's interesting enough (PG) for young audiences, perhaps even family, though it's a little much rawhide and occasional stampedes for pre-teenagers.  The plot's predictable enough- young cowboy coming of age in the 1880's.  Kirk Douglas (I have to say, obviously the box-office draw in a case like this), plays two leads simultaneously, brothers from the U.S.-one a self-made wealthy rancher, the other a now grizzled prospector seeking that gold-strike of a lifetime.  The hero, Jim Henry (Tom Burlinson's debut) slowly (and I do mean slowly, by most Western standards) develops into a self-respecting outback hombre, defying the wealthy Harrison's (Douglas) eventually shaky hold on his (Harrison's) daughter, Jessica (Sigrid Thornton, the love interest), while claiming the long-awaited manly nod of approval from the prospector Spur (also played by Mr. Douglas).  You get the expected occasional breath-taking sky-scapes and cast of cowboys (I speak as a yank galoot here, I suppose), galloping pell-mell over the landscape to secure the rancher's prize escaped horse.  It would have made a good Walt Disney production way back when.  I still wonder about Jim's achievement of manhood over exteriors as large as this one.",1467936000,"07 8, 2016",3.0,0

"I must have been watching a different movie from some of the other posters because this movie was not only boring but also rambling. Rob Zombie has this annoying trademark of doing everything but literaly forcing you to sympathize with the 'bad guys'. Between the generic and predictable back stories to the sappy music he plays around his antagonists. I LOVE the original Halloween and Halloween 2. As a matter of fact every Halloween movie but 3 was better, and SCARIER, than this movie. I would have loved it if Rob had just made another entry, an original one, in the series rather than trying to turn an already great movie into the generic troubled kid next door scenario. Most of Micheal Myers' mystique was NOT KNOWING what the hell was going on behind that mask. Knowing made me like him less and it made me see him as much less threatening. Two things I doubt Mr. Zombie was goinmg for. ALSO a few things that bothered me about the 're make'Myers family seemed to be a middle class working family that didn't seem to stand out for any reason in the original. In the remake they are poor white trash. Even the houses fence and landscaping are much different.They actualy show Micheal in Halloween 2 I think, Maybe 1, for a flash and hes not a long haired blonde kid.How the hell, in Zombies version, did Micheal know Laurie was his sister? And whynot kill her when he was a child? She was 'innocent' I suppose...blech. Thats the problem with over explaining things. You cant explain some of the minute details and not others that actualy lend to the story.So he pops out, or pops in, Loomis' eyes yet in the very next scene there is no blood and he can see? WTF.Laurie Strode was not as big a pussy in the original and Zombie killing her parents in this version seemed very silly.Rob Zombie, for the love of god please stop using the same cast in every movie. It may work for comedys but this is getting annoying.Some of you will say this wasn't a remake at all but a retelling of the story in Rob Zombie world...I say whatever. I DO NOT recommend this movie at all for any reason. This is the first horror movie ever that has actualy BORED me and I have seen ALOT of horror movies.

"""Room 514"" is an artfully crafted movie. Using only a handful of actors and dominated by the claustrophobic confines of the title interrogation room, it lays out the story of Anna, an underdog Israeli army investigator. Anna is a conscripted military investigator seeking insight into events that take place beyond far beyond her span of control (an operational unit in the Israeli/Occupied territories, and persons of interest that increase in rank --and their commitment to the military as a career) as she defies logical processes that might convince her to just let go.Viewers without some familiarity with the Israeli military (and its mostly compulsory military service) and the political climate of the Levant will be challenged to take away much from this movie. This is not the movie's fault, since it's Israeli made (in Hebrew with English subtitles). Beyond that, even with the sparest of sets and actors, familiar military movie tropes abound:-conscript vs. careerist-enlisted vs. officer-junior investigator vs. senior accused-forward operational issues vs. rear echelon regulation.Anna reveals multiple issues during the course of her face to face and telephonic issues: mommy issues, male/daddy issues, issues with authority. An extended --and I would argue, gratuitous, even with both participants fully clothed-- ""tryst"" with her lover in the interrogation room does little to advance the story, while doing plenty to prompt questions about Anna's ultimate regard for the institution she is professing to serve with the truth.In the end, I found the craft of this movie to overwhelm its narrative, and wished we could have had at least as much information as Anna did as each conversant appeared. Between the lack of context and the jarring, single-room venue that dominates, this movie takes a lot of work to absorb.Is this movie worth renting and the time it takes to watch it? Absolutely. But if you've entered it with high expectations based on critical acclaim from film festival buzz, you might want to temper those.Note: Film Movement provided a copy of this movie for review.",1371340800,"06 16, 2013",3.0,0

"Father Amaro (Gael Garcia Bernal) is a young priest sent to work in the small, rural town of Los Reyes, Mexico. Father Amaro is idealistic at first. But soon discovers that his senior priest, Father Benito, has an ongoing affair with a local woman named Sanjuanera and that he is also laundering drug money for some murderous narco-traffickers in order to raise funds to build a ""First World quality"" hospital.Soon Father Amaro finds himself involved in his own forbidden love affair with a romantically obsessed young girl named Amelia (Ana Claudia Talacon). When Amelia becomes pregnant the selfish Father Amaro seeks to protect his own career by pressuring Amelia into having an abortion. But the illegal abortion is botched and Amelia ends up bleeding to death. Yet, despite all his horrific misdeeds, Father Amaro is wrongly credited as being a hero for trying to save Amelia while the blame for her pregnancy and abortion is falsely placed on her ""heretic"" ex-boyfriend.This movie depicts a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions, with the worst characters, most notably Father Amaro himself, making out fine. While those with good intentions tend to suffer. For instance, the idealistic Father Natalio is ex-communicated by the Church for his devotion to a village of poor peasants. So, yes, this movie does offer a critique on the corruption within the Catholic Church. But, more importantly, it is about the corruption of the soul, which each of us, as human beings, are susceptible to.""The Crimes Of Father Amaro"" was one of the first in what has turned out to be a long line of intelligent, artistic Mexican films made over the last 5 years.

"This one completely slipped my notice multiple times, and I had no interest but boredom when I put it on. It proceeded to take an ungodly amount of time to get to the actual story, but somehow managed to keep me intrigued with a litany of seemingly loosely related snippets involving Muirhouse talking about ghost hunting and what he does, discussing it on a radio show or via interviews.Then we begin with him going into a haunted house with his setup of cameras, and he almost immediately starts getting the spooky ghosty encounters.The way they were executed and filmed was sublime in its subtlety, and at most points is ambivalent enough to be unclear if it actually is a spooky ghost or a home invader seeking solely to scare and harass him as he ghost hunts.The ""jump scare"" moments are fairly typical but also incredibly creepy given the ""found footage"" realism-style it was going for.But once it reaches a long, extended sequence of quiet dread, in which you're left looking over every inch of the screen for any sign of something anomalous while Muirhouse is just staring around, waiting to hear something pounding upstairs or a door slamming again, it abruptly goes all-in with its ghostly climax...And then it just suddenly ends.I'm someone who absolutely loves certain things, and in particular found footage horror/sci fi movies, even if they're terrible. If they manage to become genuinely exciting or compelling, I often prefer them to not be overly long or indulgent for fear of spoiling the experience.This film went the complete other way, ending too soon after having done too little.",1521244800,"03 17, 2018",2.0,-1

People were returning them to the stores saying they were malfunctioning because they were ""pegged"" when pointed at electric stovetop burners, hair dryers, and out the window onto the street. Fact is, they were working perfectly. All of those items emit microwave energy that is hundreds to millions of times what a microwave oven does.Your handheld hair dryer emits more than 1,000,000 times the microwave radiation of your smart meter; and you hold it pointed directly at your head for several minutes every morning after you get out of your shower.And the biggest microwave radiation emitter on the face of the earth (literally, on the face of the earth) is the asphalt road that runs in front of your home.When you see the ""heat wave"" rising from the street in front of your house on a summer day, that heat wave is 100% microwave radiation at an intensity that heats your entire body from the inside out. Can your ""smart"" electric meter do that?.Those are the scientific facts. No discussion, no proof, no argument. That ship has already sailed, those trains have already left the station. Those are the facts. All you have to do to verify these facts are go to your local High School and ask the Physics teacher to show you the chart she/he has on the wall of the ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM. Then ask him/her to explain to you something thermodynamics people call, ""Black Body Radiation"".That black asphalt in front of your house is being heated by the sun and photons are being absorbed and ""re-emitted"" from the asphalt. That high school physics teacher will tell you that is ""black body radiation"". He/she will also tell you all of it is in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum. We are talking MILLIONS of watts of radiated microwave power. The person who wrote, directed, produced this ""documentary"" knows none of these facts.The writer, producer, director is trying to convince you that millionths of a watt (microwatts) from a Smart Power Meter is killing you, while he forgets to mention the megawatts of microwave energy you are exposed to crossing a black asphalt street on a sunny summer day.This movie is fear mongering of the most despicable kind.I have a ""smart meter"" on my house. I have ""smart meters"" on my rental property houses. Nobody in any neighborhood I own property in has had a house burn down. Nobody; from any cause. Period.  His ""proof"" that ""smart meters"" cause house fires is an anecdotal report from a phone call that wasn't recorded to a person who isn't named. His interview of a person whose ""house"" (?) burned down was an interview of someone whose ""house"" was in such poor / substandard condition that there is a greater likelihood that the owner set fire to that structure in order to collect the insurance money.

"Freedomland tries oh so hard to be both a crime thriller and social commentary that it fails at both.  Instead of insight into the realities of race in America, or an interesting story with creative twists, Freedomland delivers an uneven, ham-fisted movie that is more pretentious than deep.I won't go into the details of the plot.  Other reviews have already done so with great clarity.  I will state, however, that the acting is surprisingly good despite the mostly horrid dialogue.  I felt particularly sympathetic for Julianne Moore.  Her dialogue was a mess, especially during the important moments, such as the big reveal at the end.  It's hard to imagine her wreck of a character switching from surprising eloquence to an almost catatonic state and back again in mere seconds, despite whatever mental instability she may have had.  Some of these sudden shifts in tone and dialogue no doubt stem from the director's sense of artistic license, but in this case less would have definitely generated a better result.The movie itself, from a plot standpoint, is muddled.  Some of it is paint-by-numbers, namely how the racial tension inevitably turns into full-scale riots.  Some of it is just a bit weird, specifically Samuel L. Jackson's character's forgiveness of Moore's character.  His faith aside, it just seems too much of a stretch, especially since his character explicitly comments about how jaded he is in humanity as a whole.  Moore's character, and her selfish choices, seem to be the last possible catalyst for the changes in Jackson's character.  And yet, it still inexplicably happens.Freedomland is definitely a movie delivered with conviction.  It just seems to be confused about what it's actually trying to say.

"Life on earth is threatened by the effects of huge solar explosions known as coronal mass ejections (CME's), in Solar Attack (2005), a direct to video production from Lions Gate, with a storyline that falls into a very familiar pattern.Scientist and businessman Lucas Foster (Mark Dacascos) is involved in the study of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  When his space shuttlelike vehicle burns up in the upper atmosphere, while on a mission to measure methane levels, Foster becomes convinced that the planet faces impending disaster.  The CME's are penetrating the weakened ozone layer, and igniting methane in the upper atmosphere.  These fires in the sky, threaten to burn up all the oxygen on the planet, and extinguish all life on Earth.After more areas of the sky catch on fire, and satellites begin to fall out of orbit and crash land, Foster presents his theory of impending destruction to the President (Louis Gossett Jr.).  As the situation worsens, communication becomes spotty, and more areas of the globe are destroyed.  Foster's proposed solution of detonating nuclear missiles at the North Pole, launched from a submarine, may be familiar to anyone that remembers the movie Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961).  While the US and Soviet governments dance around, time is running out, leaving Foster little option but to act on his own, to try and save the world.Fortuitously, the commander of a Soviet submarine near the north pole, is Foster's personal friend, and he manages to get aboard, and convince his Russian comrade to fire his missiles.  After a ton of submarine related clichs, the missiles are finally launched, and the planet is spared.Filled with clichs and elements that have been used before, Solar Attack isn't horrible, it's just unoriginal, predictable, and not terribly interesting or suspenseful, with production values similar to a Sy Fy production.  The special effects are not overdone, and are rather pedestrian.  Mark Dacascos and most of the cast do what they can with the material, but it's hard to take this film seriously.  If you are interested, you may want to tune in if you happen to see it on the Sy Fy schedule.",1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2.0,-1
"Basically, you get seven horror b movies which are poor blurry transfers from VHS tapes. The movies are ""Creature"", ""Attack Of The Giant Leeches"", ""The Giant Gila Monster"", ""The Phantom From 10,000 Leagues"", ""The Killer Shrews"", ""Piranha"" (This is not the Joe Dante cult classic ""Piranha"") and ""Voyage To The Prehistoric Planet"".

Dakota Fanning - Annoying to the point that would make fingernails on a chalkboard a melody.

The Bleeders - Oh man, i have never laughed this much in my life seeing these caricatures and the faces they make. Its so ridiculosuly hilarious, talk about his resume.3. The sniffers - yuck... heading into inner wear territory4. The pusher (kira) - The girl who defines a pleasant day through the morgue.

Larson should of waited a few more years before doing Galactica again. I saw this one on TV in 1980. And I agree with everyone that the episode with Starbuck  is the best.

"I'm a 50 yr old male, happily married, couple of late teen boys...and I just have a blast watching these DVDs...I have all of them now.  I'm quite an admirer of Mr. Selleck, due to his independent conservative beliefs as well as his views on the 2nd Ammendment. I also gained GREAT respect for him for his handling of the Rosie O. attack he endured!  I also find his cowboy movies are especially terrific examples of his acting ability, great story telling there.  Never payed much attention to Magnum PI in the 80's when on TV, but now with TODAY's TV which is...well... total garbage, this show is a breath of fresh air.  So I thought I'd buy the first season of Magnum, as I recalled it was a pretty good show, plus it has Selleck.  What a great decision.  The whole cast and the way they interact is like a tight family, funny, strong and loyal ties that bind, and is great fun to watch.  You may find that a few episodes (here & there in season 4, 5, 6) are pretty simple (poorly written), BUT the actors tried to work with it and it's still the Magnum PI family.

"This movie was shown to us in my English class, along with the classic version. This movie was getting on my nerves right up to the gas station scene.

Second, the acting is terrible. The worst actor of them all was Tybalt. Third, they just act stupid. I hated just about everybody that starred in this ""masterpiece.""

"...Ahh, 1985. Molly Ringwald is the Teen Queen of the 80's and John Cusack was the Teen King.  The Sure Thing embraces John's usual craziness and opened the doors for more starring roles. This is one of my all-time favorite films. I have watched repeatedly since I was seven and I still love it.  It's the perfect 80's film all in one. It's light, fun and touching.  The Sure Thing has everything you'd need and more. The film comes equipped with hunky men, foxy ladies and enough funny one-liners to put the writers of "" Becker "" to shame. You get a fantastic road trip, top romance and the world of the 80's all in one DVD!  And as always Cusack gets his woman. If you want to see how John Cusack made his most famous mark in Hollywood, this is the film for you. If you don't give a [darn] about all that, just watch it for kicks.

Regardless Martyrs is still a pretty powerful movie that stays with you but not in the league of High Tension or Inside.",1463702400,"05 20, 2016",3.0,0
"Finally, all 22 films are here celebrating five decades of James Bond right up to the theatrical release of SKYFALL. This is an interesting and perhaps definitive Bond collection at this point in time. You get the entire series to date from DR. NO up to and including QUANTUM OF SOLACE. This is one of those ""must have"" collections. From Sean Connery to Daniel Craig and think about that one moment. Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig all played James Bond on the screen in 22 films over five decades. The diversity of the films, the actors, the directors, the technicians and all the other filmmakers is astounding. We all have our favorite films and our favorite actors portraying James Bond. It is really hard to express an opinion here other than to say that this sums it up for the first 50 years and I am glad that all the films are finally in one set. Amazing when you think about it.It is interesting at the 50 year milestone to reflect on the films and actors that have portrayed James Bond. I think we like all the films to some extent and some more than others. Some of the films are very endearing to us and others less endearing. We have our favorites. We can be passionate about such things. For me I suppose Sean Connery is the one and only James Bond. I grew up in that era. I lived through those magical times. The Bonds that followed are his and the original filmmakers' legacy. There is the natural progression of the series that continues to this day. The films I like in particular are DR. NO, GOLDFINGER, THUNDERBALL, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, A VIEW TO A KILL and THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS. For one reason or another I find these endearing and I enjoy watching them over and over again.Of all the actors that have portrayed James Bond I believe that Sean Connery embodied everything that there was that made his James Bond an icon. Of the actors that followed, my favorite is George Lazenby. He makes one film that is arguably one of the best and for the first time he brought some depth to the character that was closer to Ian Fleming's literary creation and never explored in Connery's films. George Lazenby looks very good and acts very good during certain scenes and moments and then in a split second his acting appears awkward. He lacked consistency in that department. Yet, overall he visually appears very confident, self reliant and has a certain self assuredness about him. That is the George Lazenby I remember and he was James Bond.Roger Moore brought his own interpretation to the role. I thought it was fine. In the Roger Moore films the greater participation of the team of M, Q, Moneypenny and Fredrick Gray (a regular addition to the cast in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME) changed and augmented the dynamics of the films. Soviet General Gogol (also added as a regular character in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME ) was also added into the mix. For me it all culminated in A VIEW TO A KILL. It is an end of an era in some ways. Lois Maxwell had been in every film as Miss Moneypenny and her playful banter with Bond first seen with Sean Conney in DR. NO finally came to a cheerful finale with Roger Moore in A VIEW TO A KILL. More or less, we saw them age gracefully and nostalgically over that span of time.I like Timothy Dalton's James Bond. The films returned to a much harder edged Bond. I liked Dalton's thinking man's no nonsense approach. I liked his approach of taking charge getting the job done as was reminiscent of Lazenby's approach. I prefer THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS of the two that Dalton made, but LICENCE TO KILL is a much better film than first realized and it requires a closer look. THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS and LICENCE TO KILL truly comprise the end of one era as we see many of the filmmakers on those two films end their involvement with the series.For me, GoldenEye and all the subsequent films up to and including SKYFALL have a different feel and look about them. Of the Pirece Brosnan/Daniel Craig era Bond films I gravitate towards TOMORROW NEVER DIES and QUANTUM OF SOLACE. In both of these films I see a confident and self-reliant Bond. One thing that all these films have in common is the relationship of Judy Dench's M and her dedicated civil servant. It is an interesting relationship. That is one of the strengths or weaknesses, depending on your point of view, of QUANTUM OF SOLACE. I am interested to see what SKYFALL brings.When I think of the James Bond series certain things or people come to a nostalgic mind. The music of John Barry, the sets of Ken Adam, Maurice Binder's gun barrel opening and the indelible image of Sean Connery are endearing to me.",1348531200,"09 25, 2012",5.0,1

"The two main characters in Monster are people who will never touch happiness. They may have seen happy people, had enjoyable moments, and grasp what it may mean to be happy, but the harder they fight towards it, the further away they get from it.In one of the most dramatic and successful transformations in film history, Charlize Theron plays Aileen Wuornos, a short-tempered, ugly, slow-witted, pathetic prostitute. She is on the verge of suicide when she is hit on by Selby (Christina Ricci), a frumpy, weak willed lesbian. At first Aileen violently rejects Selby's advances, but before long they are making out in an alley behind the bar. Aileen probably isn't a lesbian, but she has been used, beaten, or raped by nearly every man she has ever known, so accepting the love of another woman isn't too hard.Of course, their relationship itself is hard, as neither has any money nor a place to go that would accept them. One night, a john ties up Aileen and begins to rape her, but she manages to grab the gun she carries and shoot her attacker dead. She ditches the body and swipes his car and money, and for a few days, her and Selby enjoy booze and a hotel room. Aileen dresses as nicely as she can and applies for a few secretary positions, though her complete lack of credentials or charm ensures that she can't get a job. Desperate to keep Selby around, she goes back to hooking, and before she knows it she has blown another one of her johns away, and with his money can continue being with Selby just a bit longer.Aileen keeps coming back to the house with new cars and more money than her tricks could provide, but Selby isn't the type to ask difficult questions. Aileen is surprised by how easy it is just to kill these men and empty their wallets; she has been abused by men, and now they are getting their just desserts. Aileen always talks to Selby with the conviction of someone who sees the light at the end of the tunnel, swearing that soon they can move somewhere nicer, eat at better restaurants, and inhabit that happy world the two of them have only seen through others. When Selby finds out exactly what Aileen is doing, she protests; shortly afterwards, Aileen returns home without as much money as expected, and Selby demands Aileen head right back out and score another car.Theron does an amazing job with Aileen, who comes across as truly despicable, yet with a desire for something better that is easy to relate to. Everything in her life has been terrible, and when she finally finds someone who makes her feel good, she can't help but promise the moon and then try her hardest to provide it. Aileen rarely sees anything as her fault, and maybe not everything is, though when she shoots a kind Christian man who offered her shelter at his family's house through the back of the head, childhood rape is a tough sell.Through voiceover, she tells us that people think she has taken the easy way out by being a hooker, but that she hasn't, as being a hooker is hard work. She may believe this, but it isn't so; by murdering these men, she is indeed taking the easy way out instead of improving herself the hard way, as is Selby for lapping up the promises this wretched creature flings out at her. Consistently, both Aileen and Selby have lived their lives in terrible circumstances, and look feverishly for the easiest way they can to get out.Monster is entertaining, sad, heart-breaking, and revolting. Entertaining because of its masterful performances and direction, sad because we know that the story is true, heart-breaking because we see the squalor in which its characters inhabit, and revolting as we see them murder in cold blood and then belligerently make excuses. Monster is one of the best films about a murderer ever made, revealing the human story of Aileen, and leaving no doubt that she turned out to be worse than those who wronged her.",1142467200,"03 16, 2006",4.0,1
"Being post Star wars, Sci Fi movies have to have something that sets them apart from the Star wars movies. And the idea of a human and an Alien, who are mortal enemys, fighting it out on an unchartered planet and having to  learn to get along and survive, sounded great. It sounds like Star wars  meets the Defiant ones, but unfortunately Enemy mine dispenses of the two  creatures hatred for each other in about 20 minutes. there is a 10 minute  battle at the end. The rest of the running time consists of the human and  the alien getting to know and like each other. Which is fine, its  occasionly exciting, nearly always entertaining and its worth-while  veiwing. If it came out before Star wars it would be much more well known.  Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr are both exceptional and they carry the  whole film on there shoulders. Maybe a few more Characters here and there  would have helped.",952819200,"03 12, 2000",3.0,0

"You would think a 1951 Allied Artists western starring Madison/Calhoun and Carole Matthews, and with a title like this would be  a rousing Cavalry vs Indians semi epic-Would you not? You will be disapointed if you do. Now I love westerns, have done for 50 years or more, and I seldom find one that I can't find anything to like. At least this has Carole Matthews as ""hostess with a heart of stone/gold"", but action it does not have until the final 10' or so (of a 77' film), and even then it is badly handled by director John Rawlins, as indeed he mishandles  most of the film. Neither Madison or Calhoun, both to become good action/western stars, seem at home here, and haven't quite found their persona. Of course it's not all bad, fine photography and an excellent b/w 4.3 print, and I guess if you are a fan and completist of Rory and Guy then you will have to get this regardless of what I say. A word of warning - Do not look closely at the photos on the back cover of the Warner Archive DVD - A bit of a Spoiler, and the plot description is misleading.

And, the actors, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, and Bryce Howard do a splendid job with a bad plot.  The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is 5 stars and is really what saves this film.  The Village should be in everyone's private film library because it is the best example of M.

"When this movie started off, it awsome when they robbed alot of kilos of drugs,, it was also a pretty good stry, and it had loads of action packed sceenes.  But the problems are, the movie is pretty slow paced, but I really didn't care, but the ending was the most dissapointing part of the movie.  I thought it was gonna be another, mr. I'm gonna grab 2 machine guns and blast  everyone ending, which I like.  But only 3 people die, and no machine guns are used in the climax.  Is that the kind of ending people expect from a movie throughout the first 70 minutes with guns blazing and rocket launchers blowing up?  A simple answer, no.  What ever happend to the movies who had a huge punch in the ending, like Scarface, The Matrix, Exit Wounds, The Terminator, 1 and 2, and alot of other movies.  Lemme guess, maybe it's cuz this movie was PG-13, instead of R.  Well if that's the case, whoever said PG-13 action movies are dumb are absolutly correct.

"One of the last in ""the giant monster from sea"" genre of the 50's""Gorgo"" officially being the last in 1961 before the japan importscame in.  The story concerns that of a mysterious radioactive force thatnot only seems to wash up mountains of dead fish on england shorebut infects one man's hand & kills another.

"Just as Mills&Boon's send their romantic fiction writers a list of guidelines to which they must strictly conform, so there must exist similar rules sent to countries hoping to be nominated for a 'Best Foreign Language film' Oscar.  'Secrets of the Heart' (which sounds like a M&B title) is just like every other derivative melodrama nominated by the Academy you've ever seen.  It is a rites-of-passage narrative set during the Cuban Misile Crisis, centred on an 'appealing' young boy who lives with his spinster aunts (one uptight, the other an alcoholic) and an older brother with whom he attends a Christian Brothers school.  His widowed mother lives at home with his uncle and grandfather, and there are dark family secrets that must not be mentioned.  Tell a boy, of course, not to do something, and it's the first thing he'll do.  He's like a detective uncovering the truth hidden by adult 'lies'.The theme of secrets is initiated by his brother's story of a house neighbouring their school where a murder once took place.  The Freudian symbolism of the house - with its web-like gate and the speeding train that interrupts the boys' spying - suggests that the real secret is sex.  In his mother's house, in a Basque village they visit for Easter holidays, is a secret room in which his father shot himself, but the house's real 'secret' is that mummy and uncle enjoy each other's company.  His brother is suspended from school for a fight with a boy over a girl who, in true rites-of-passage style, sells peephole abovetheknee views for a hefty charge.  His alco aunt has an admirer from her past.  So his initiation is into the world of sex, which initially seems violent, violating and bestial (when he witnesses the mating of dogs), then secret, shameful and distorted (the adults).  His growth is predictably symbolised by a bridge of stepping stones he can't negotiate at the beginning - the currents they overlook claim one victim of adult sexuality, a wife who can't take her husband's abuse any more.  The fairy-tale operetta the brothers star in adds a paralell narrative in which the hero (played by the young boy) negotiates puberty-symbolic dangers through Freudian motifs such as monsters in forests.  There are even the obligatory scenes of the young boy learning to dance.A film that has been preposterously compared to Victor Erice's incomparable 'Spirit of the Beehive', the hidden secrets of Francoist repression figure in 'Secrets', in the gloomily taciturn person of priest-hating grandad and his socially ostracised ex-chum.All these predictable crises and trite reconciliations are bathed in the kind of queasily warm cinematographic glow, local 'colour' and tinkling music that makes 'Jean de Florette'  look unforgivingly avant-garde.",1020038400,"04 29, 2002",1.0,-1

No passion...no expressions...no change in tone of voice through the entire movie.Not blaming her for the total failure of the movie, though.  There was so much to blame. The script was awful...deadly dull dialog, boring plot, very little suspense, hard to follow.  There were too many cliches especially the fact that the ""good guy"", the Priest, ended up being evil and killing more folks than the werewolf did. I get so tired of people who serve God being portrayed as evil. Boring!I could hardly make it through to the end.

There's not a lot of Piratey ship action, instead it's pirate politics and infighting. The entire first season won't be available for months after the first episode is released on Amazon. hard to create and maintain interest in casual fans in that long delay.If you want a Game of Thrones type show, watch Game of Thrones.

"A terrible movie and a complete waste of time, unless you are a big fan of computer games such as Call of Duty World at War and Black Ops. It is an almost uninterrupted orgy of noise and screams. After ten minutes I was totally exhausted. The characters are completely one-dimensional. Macho men running and shooting at everything that moves. They communicate by cliche oneliners. The storyline is as flat as the heartbeat of a recently deceased person. After fifteen minutes or so, I was so bored, numbed and fed up by it all that I ""switched off"", crept behind my newspaper and left it to my son and his friends to complete the viewing. From behind the newspaper I patiently endured the endless string of gunshots, explosions and shouted commands. Do not be fooled: there's hardly any science in this fiction, it's just a ""one-in-a-dozen"" war movie. I cherished the silence as almost never before when at last the TV set was switched off. I couldn't have cared less if the aliens had won.",1303171200,"04 19, 2011",1.0,-1
"I got dragged to this hideous feature by two female friends who had seen and loved the first film.  I hadn't, but I was filled in on the background before it began, and references were explained to me.Basically, it's a romance involving an insecure fat girl (Renee Zellweger) and the two men who are competing for her affection. She is in love with an human rights lawyer (Colin Firth) whom she has been with for two whole months but finds herself occasionally drawn to a funny, charming, but ultimately slimy TV show host (Hugh Grant.)I couldn't for the life of me figure out why anyone would be fighting over this woman. She's an idiot. She constantly humiliates Firth's character in front of his professional colleagues. She is completely inept at nearly everything. And none of this is even remotely cute or endearing. Conversely, I couldn't understand what she saw in her boyfriend, who has all the personality of the desk I'm sitting at. Oh, right, the shagging was good. We are reminded of that many, many times over. Grant's character is a jerk, but at least he's funny.Zellweger is incredibly annoying, with her fake English accent and exaggerated mannerisms. Roger Ebert says he wanted to tickle her under her chin. I wanted to punch her in the eye.  Do women actually relate to this character?  That's so very sad.Hugh Grant is the only entertaining thing in the movie. His scenes were the only times I genuinely laughed.The film is nauseatingly sweet at the worst of times, and predictable as well. If you can't see what's coming when someone asks the main character to carry a souvenir item from Thailand in her luggage, then you just haven't seen enough movies. By the time Bridget is singing Madonna songs in a Thai prison, you'll be wanting to ram skewers into both your eyes and ears.This isn't the worst film I've ever seen, but it is unquestionably the worst film I've seen in theaters in the past year.",1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2.0,-1

"Taken / B001TODCII*Spoilers*I think it's probably safe to say that no one is going to be terribly surprised or thought-provoked by ""Taken"". The movie is straightforward and simple, almost quaintly so in an era where we've come to expect every movie to have a dramatic twist ending in which it turns out that an ancillary character (the best friend? the aging husband? the bitter wife?) was the actual mastermind behind everything. ""Taken"" has no such twists, partly because they've become a bit overdone in the movie industry, but mostly because such a twist would have undermined Neeson's hard-earned 'I told you so' as well as the (probably unintentional) movie subtext that pretty young women should never leave their fathers' homes - or for that matter the motherland.Indeed, it's difficult to say how much of the movie is meant to be a searing attack on women... Neeson's ex-wife palatably drips evil and malice, and his darling daughter is almost a caricature of the stereotypical spoiled brat - throwing a temper tantrum that would shame a three-year-old when Daddy doesn't instantly sign off on an exotic European getaway. When the daughter and girlfriend are kidnapped into white slavery for being imprudent enough to flirt with an attractive stranger on a busy street in a foreign country, the sexually active girl dies almost immediately and is never mentioned again in the film. Neeson's daughter, on the other hand, is a pure-as-the-driven-snow virgin, allowing him a crucial extra few hours to try to save her as she is shuttled off to the expensive and exclusive 'virgin auction'. Although I'm probably reading WAY too much into the movie with all this subtext - after all, this is supposed to be a fun, mindless shoot-em-up, not a dissertation on the evils of society.All tongue-in-cheek aside, ""Taken"" is a fine action movie if you're just looking for people to get blown up, shot, and run over by cars. Quite a few of the characters fail to act sensibly (like the slave-trader who is uncooperative for no reason at all except as a method to work in a torture scene), and some of the action feels a bit too pretentious - like a deliberate attempt to push the envelope. For example, when Neeson shots innocent people in order to get their loved ones to cooperate - the action doesn't make sense and simply doesn't fit the character, but we're out to push buttons here, not build a believable storyline. I recommend ""Taken"" for a fun, mindless action movie to pass the time, but I wouldn't waste too much time trying to find sense in it - this is a spectacle movie, not a philosophical one.~ Ana Mardoll",1249862400,"08 10, 2009",4.0,1

"Warning if you believe the old testament word for word, do not see this movie as it will undoubtedly offend you!This is just another case of a comedian (Jack Black) doing a movie based mostly on slapstick/childish humor without a real storyline.If the movie was to mock the history of humankind represented in the old testament, it spent most of the time just mishmashing parts of the bible into a nonsensical stand up comedy. While this might work in an SNL skit, it should not be dragged out into a 100 minute long movie.short synopsis, the movie begins with the beginning of humankind (biblical timeline) where one cavemen (played by Jack Black) eats the forbidden fruit to obtain godlike knowledge & his sidekick ""O"" (played by Michael Cera) is compelled to follow him throughout most of the movie.Kicked out (of I guess paradise) by their tribe for having eaten the forbidden fruit, the two cavemen venture forth into the unknown stumbling from one biblical storyline to the next.There seemed little purpose in this movie except the use of satire on parts of the old testament. While I do not think the humor is that bad, I agree with most that it is not great either and without a real storyline to go by, the movie lacks any purpose or motive for one to watch it.Compare this to Monty Python's ""The Life of Brian"" and you may understand why  a storyline is so desperately needed.Unlike ""The Life of Brian"", ""Year One"" jumps from one story to the next and there is no real purpose to their adventures except at the end when it is indicated that no one person is chosen by God to lead/follow any particular belief/ritual, but that all are chosen by God to make her/his own decision as to what is right or wrong. Pretty weak and a bit of a copout if you are trying to make a point in a movie.Oh well, I do not hate it because I saw it on cable, but if I had to pay for it in a movie theater, I could understand those who gave it one or two stars.",1293580800,"12 29, 2010",3.0,0

"A homemade movie is a beautiful thing. What starts out as a simple project can quickly turn into something bigger, especially when a virus hits the United States and starts bringing people back from the dead.Welcome to George Romero's DIARY OF THE DEAD.Set in Pennsylvania and following a group of University of Pittsburgh students, DIARY OF THE DEAD chronicles a group of survivor's journey from beginning to end. Starting in the woods during a senior project film project, the group is quickly distracted after Elliot--the braniac--tells everyone that they `need to hear this.'`This' happens to be the reports that the dead are coming back to life.After the mummy (the `monster' of the movie) and his girlfriend leave the scene, the rest of the group quickly decide to leave. Mary--who's woman in command of a good-sized camp trailer--begins to take them back home, but not before something strange becomes apparent. When a burned-beyond-recognition cop stumbles from the scene of an accident and into traffic, Mary quickly stops the camper, then pushes past him and onto the main road.She runs over three people--three `dead' people.Traumatized beyond belief, they pull over on the side of the road, only to have Mary attempt an act of suicide.In a desperate rush to save their friend, the group flees to the hospital.It soon becomes apparent that this isn't all a hoax when they find the hospital abandoned of people.As a fan of Romero's original DEAD trilogy (consisting of Night of the Living Dead, Dawn and Day of the Dead,) as well as the fourth installment LAND, I was more than willing to watch this unique and fifth installment, although I will admit to being a bit wary about it being shot in a handheld/over-the-shoulder-camera angle. I was quickly able to get past this insecurity though, as the film is shot with stability and without a lot of rough running and tilting. The main thing I liked about the movie was the fact that it was shot like it was--from the perspective of a few college men and women with a camera.Now, although I enjoyed this movie, I did have a few quirks with it.-- In the beginning, Deborah (the main narrator of the `film') mentions that she's `edited the footage' and `added music' in an attempt to scare the viewer. Why, I ask, would someone attempt (or want) to do this when they're running from the end of the world? It begs to question the motive of the film, and the footage we as the viewers see. Did we see the end of the world from the perspective of a few college students, or were we hoaxed with some elaborate special affects--CGI and trick camera angles meant to confuse the viewer. We also have to take into consideration that, if they WERE really in the end of the world, and the internet WAS failing, how did they upload it to the internet, if they even did? Did the group survive and eventually upload the video after the United States became stable, or did another survivor find their footage, then view it as we the audience did? I can only assume that this `fault' (if you would even call it that) was Romero's way of making us question the film. Like Night and its racial undertones, Dawn and its commercial abstraction, and Day and its confusion with the military, I can only assume that Diary was meant to symbolize the media and how we can't always believe what we see on TV.-- There were points during the movie--particularly when the Texan woman took off in the camper--that seemed unrealistic. During the point in which the group is attacked, then rescued by a group of survivors holing up in a warehouse, Deborah demands for the leader to give them food while a gun is being shoved in her face. The fact that any person in their right mind would do this is beyond me. Given the way the group originally attacked Elliot and knocked him down to the ground, it surprised me that the warehouse survivors would so easily give into helpless stranger's demands. As also mentioned above, the blonde-haired Texan woman took off in the camper for no apparent or logical reason near the end of the movie. I can understand why someone would suddenly take off on a whim like she did (from fear, confusion or panic,) but up until that point, she seemed extremely stable, especially after having to kill her boyfriend. Deborah experienced the same kind of character development problems. Her whole family was murdered in front of her eyes, yet she only seems slightly disturbed and says, `Thank you?' I screamed and bawled my eyes out when I thought my cat was hit by a car a few months back--I can't imagine just sitting there like I'd just been punched in the gut after my whole family was killed.-- Character development was also faintly sparse throughout the movie. While some characters developed extremely well (Deborah, despite her blunt emotions, and the professor, despite his quiet demeanor,) the majority of them remained the same and two-dimensional. Jake seemed to care about nothing more than filming, even going so far as to leave the group in order to keep filming, the Texan woman isn't traumatized by her boyfriend's death and takes off without warning, and the professor's only real point is to say the occasional insightful thing, and be a complete badass with a bow.Despite my three major points with the movie, I can say that I enjoyed DIARY OF THE DEAD more than any other movie I've tried to watch recently. The tension keeps you going, the action is done in traditional Romero style, and the metaphorical undertones spruced throughout the story make you question the intent of the film.Although I can't say that Diary has taken its spot as my favorite (or second or third favorite) zombie movie, I have to place it in my top ten. It kept me entertained--I don't see why it can't why it wouldn't keep another Romero fan on the edge of their seats.",1256428800,"10 25, 2009",3.0,0

"This was a good movie for movie's sake.  It touches on a time period/culture that is rarely given any face time in cinema(I know there are many Korean films out there, but not so many that cover this subject matter).  The scenery, costume, and set design are gorgeous!  And while there IS action in this film, there is much more going on within the personal relationships of the Queen and her Bodyguard.  It almost has sort of a Romeo and Juliet quality to it.As for the title of this review...the action in this movie is pretty intricate and plays liberally with human physics.  It's a lot of fun to watch when those scenes are up.  However, they don't last very long and are somewhat spread out (which is fine because the movie isn't all about action).  The end of this movie was somewhat anticlimactic for how BA this leading character was supposed to be.  I won't put any spoilers in place about the ending, but the reason I gave this review its particular title is because our hero doesn't actually wield a sword until the last 15 minutes of the film.  Instead, he opts for this very cleaver-shaped broad knife as his weapon of choice.  He uses it well, but I'm not sure how they came up with the title of this film using that as a reference.Overall, this is an enjoyable watch.  As for my taste, I would have probably rented it instead.  I did not love it enough to watch more than maybe twice a year.",1322697600,"12 1, 2011",3.0,0

"Kudos to MGM for restoring this important film landmark and also including the ""smilebox"" simulated CINERAMA version.  The documentary CINERAMA ADVENTURE is another great reason to add this title to your library. It remains the best Cinerama title in the format's short history.  The BluRay transfer is sharp and has a excellent blacks and contrast rations on my 1080i 50"" plasma screen.  I'd want to see 1080p on LCD before passing final judgment though.The film content itself is quite anachronistic and represents the nationalistic views of the era in which it was made; it was a surprise to be reminded that HTWWW won an Oscar for best screenplay!  The story rambles like the wide Missouri but the film still entertains well enough after 45 years.  The final shots of the LA freeway systems being used to illustrate how well the conquest of the indigenous Americans all turned out is unintentionally sardonic.",1221177600,"09 12, 2008",4.0,1

"This has been one of my all time favorite movies since it's 1991 release. When I recieved my copy of the Ultimate Edition, something was wrong. I have a rather slow DVD player so I had to watch something else first to warm it up. But it was worth the wait. I had no idea that they could fit so much extra stuff onto one DVD.Three versions of the film, three documentaries, four trailers, audio commentary, spectacular picture and sound, kick [butt] animated menus, talent profiles, script and a full supplement that will take you until Judgment Day to finish reading. Awesome!Onto Brandon's DVD scale:Movie: 5/5. Arnold's greatest movie ever. Cameron's best too.Picture and Sound: 5/5. As good as it's ever gonna get.Extras: 5/5. They don't call it the Ultimate Edition for nothing.Final verdict: 10. Probably the best DVD ever made. Well, I guess I'll have to wait for the Star Wars movies to be released on DVD before I jump to that conclusion.If you love the movie, you'll love the DVD. Highly recommended.

"I generally prefer buying my movies on iTunes as I believe discs are a thing of the past and this is yet another example as to why I'd have been better off.I figured for the same price, I'd buy the Blu-Ray (which is High Definition) since they now include a 'Digital Copy', which essentially is the movie for your iTunes library.So if I'm paying for the high definition movie, why would they give me a standard definition iTunes copy? I would have been better off spending $4 LESS and buying it directly in iTunes, where the quality would have been true 1080p HD. This digital copy is hardly 720p (closer to 480p).

"Was the title for one of the best reviews I read for Pretty Woman back when I was only fifteen years of age. I was forbidden to see the film, my mother thinking I would instantly be standing on street corners looking for Lotuses, but I saw it anyway. Three times. When it came on video I watched it until the tape died and I needed to buy another, and another. Then, I bought a DVD player JUST for it. I've gotten into many heated discussions about how this movie degrades women and gives young girls the wrong ideas about things. But that is NOT how I look at it at all.My favorite scene in the movie is when Vivian and Edward are in bed, talking and Vivian goes on about how she ended up in Los Angeles to begin with by following a ""bum"" that her mother called her a ""bum magnet"" ""If there was a bum within a fifty mile radius I was completly attracted to him."" But the line that stuck with me the most was ""When people put you down enough you start to believe it"" and Edward replies ""I think you are a very charming, very beautiful woman"" Vivians reply is full of emotion when she replies ""The bad stuff is easier to believe...have you ever noticed that?"" Which is true.Maybe it's just me, but I think that this movie is just a fairytale, and fairytales are there to make you believe in something that is totally unbelievable. This movie gives you hope, show's you that even if you're life is misserable, that even if you are a bum magnet; if you don't give up hope a millionare in a Lotus might be just around the corner.""Welcome to Hollywood, what's your dream?

"2 1/2 hours of instruction (with illustrations) in how badly behaved adult males can be when unchaperoned was way more than I signed up for.Problems with the film:1. Way too long.2. The unattractive Romanian locales bear no resemblance to the Smokies. I had to suspend my disbelief, as it were, for the obvious disconnect. I'm guessing, based on the somewhat acerbic commentary at the beginning of the movie, by the late Anthony Minghella, that the Romanian venue choice was due to budget considerations. (It also provided grist for the London tabloids' later reporting of the Jude Law/Nicole Kidman brouhaha.)3. Given the low moral estate of many of the male characters, it beggars belief that the evil ""Teague"" would have limited his interest in Kidman to mere ogling. Serial rape would have been Kidman's fate in reality, no matter what the late Mr. Minghella might have imagined.4. The upcountry North Carolinians were not rabid supporters of the Confederacy as they were portrayed in the movie. Many, in fact, wanted to have nothing to do with the war. They were, and still are, an independent lot. What else would you expect from Scotch-Irish?5. The final shootout was disappointing.

"Seems as though the fans of the whole Friday The 13th franchise can never get enough. In 1982, director Steve Miner brought us another sequel entitled, Friday The 13th Part 3, Steve Miner's second turn in directing a Friday The 13th film, his first being 1981's Friday The 13th Part 2.  In this horrifying chapter, which starts off by showing what happened at the end of the second film, Jason (played by Richard Brooker) goes on to feed on more victims. Now, this sequel is sort of a continuation of the last film, just like Halloween 2 continued on from the first Halloween. First, Jason stumbles onto a married couple named Harold and Edna. Harold is an insecure man, who allows his b*tch of a wife order him around. Edna watches the news and find out about the murders from the second film (when this film is actually taking place only a day after the second film). At that moment, Harold comes running into the house to ""make a call to nature"". He finishes his bathroom business, but he hears a strange noise coming from outside the bathroom door. He opens the door and Jason knocks him off, where Jason then kills Edna.  The next morning, a van pulls up into a nice looking neighborhood. Inside the van are Chris Higgins (played by Dana Kimmell), Debbie (played by Tracie Savage), Andy (Jeffrey Rogers), Shelley (played by Larry Zerner), and potheads, Chuck (played by David Katims) and Chili (played by Rachel Howard). They are on their way to Chris' family cabin in Camp Crystal Lake for the weekend. Right now, they're stopping to pick up Vera Sanchez (played by Catherine Parks), a girl who is going along as a date for Shelley. Shelley is very insecure about his looks and weight. In order for him to get people to like him, he has to scare the ever-loving sh*t out of them.  The friends pull up to the cabin, where Chris is greeted by her boyfriend, Rick (played by Paul Kratka). After another Shelley-scaring-the-hell-out-everyone joke, Vera and Shelley drive off to the grocery store to get some food for the weekend, where they have a run-in with three bikers named, Ali (played by Nick Savage), Loco (played by Kevin O'Brien), and Fox (played by Gloria Charles). Shelley pays them back with revenge, but not before the bikers follow them back to the cabin, where they plan to set the kids' barn on fire. Before they even have a chance to burn the place, Jason takes care of business with the three of them.  That night, Chris and Rick go for a long ride, just to catch up on things. Chris hasn't seen Rick for two years, since she hadn't gone back until now. Her reason: she was attacked by Jason and nearly killed by him. As she tells Rick the story of her terrifying ordeal, their car breaks down, `causing them to walk back to the cabin.  At the cabin, Debbie and Andy have a little fun in the sac, until Debbie goes to get a shower. Andy goes for a beer, but is evilly greeted by Jason. Debbie finishes her shower and goes to bed, but she is then killed by Jason. Shelley again scares the crap out of Vera, this time where an old goalie mask. He goes off into the barn, all hurt from the way Vera yelled at him. But Shelley does not come back out; Jason comes out, wearing the goalie mask. He finds Vera and shows her how to play darts with just her left eye.  Chuck and Chili also greet their demise. Chris and Rick return, but Rick is suddenly killed by Jason. Chris is all alone to battle Jason. She battles him in the barn. As she battles Jason, Ali suddenly appears to be alive. He tries to help Chris out, but Jason really finishes him off. As he kills Ali, Chris grabs an axe and jams it into Jason's forehead. He drops down to the ground and appears to be dead. It is then where Chris realizes that Jason is the one who attacked her all those years ago.  Chris then goes off into a canoe and falls asleep. She wakes up and is relieved to find that morning has arrived. She finds Jason still alive and is running after her. As she tries to sail away with the canoe, she finds that she was only hallucinating. But at that moment, Mrs. Voorhees' dead body jumps up out of the lake and grabs Chris violently and pulls her underneath the water. But Chris is lucky to find that it was only dream. Chris is unlucky in the fact that she has gone completely mental from this whole ordeal.  I told you twice before: no more camping until Jason is finished having his fun.

"No Nightcrawler. No Storm. No Cyclops. No Rogue. No Gambit. And there's a noticeable lack of dignified old men like Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen.Yes, this is not the X-Men you're used to. ""X-Men: First Class"" goes back to the 1960s to tell the origin stories of both the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants, as well as their charismatic leaders Professor X and Magneto. The story itself is a puff piece used to introduce the characters, but the performances by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are absolutely spellbinding.In the 1960s, a CIA sting operation discovers that the the cruel Sebastien Shaw (Kevin Bacon) (who is working with the Russians) also has a small group of superpowered mutants who can teleport, read minds, and so on. And the existence of mutants is proven to the government by mind-reading telepath Charles Xavier (McAvoy) and his foster sister Raven (Jennifer Lawrence).With Shaw planning to spark off a nuclear war between Russia and the US, Xavier begins gathering his own group of mutants -- including Erik Lensherr, a Holocaust survivor who is hell-bent on killing Shaw. The mutants begin training themselves so they can use their abilities to the fullest, but they may not be a match for Shaw... and even worse, Erik might be.""X-Men: First Class"" as a pretty fluffy main plot, since its main purpose is to bring Erik and Charles together as best buddies... only to have them splinter off in two very different directions. Yes, there's a lot of stuff about the Cuban missile crisis and impending nuclear doom, but it feels like it's just a backdrop for the REAL drama.But it is a pretty fun popcorn movie, though not as powerful as the first two X-Men movies. There are some very striking moments (the FLYING SUBMARINE! Epic!), and some pretty impressive action scenes. However, director Matthew Vaughn really underplays some important scenes (such as Beast's transformation), and he really beats you over the head with the gay parallels of the mutants (""You didn't ask"").As for the cast, the villains are pretty lackluster. Bacon gives a good performance, but he feels strangely out of place, as if he doesn't quite click into the story. And January Jones -- aka ""sparkly Christmas ornament with breasts"" -- gives a performance like garden tools scraping through a chalkboard. She is so annoying that she actually infects any scene she's in. And sadly, there is an ugly undercurrent of misogyny running through the story, with all the women explicitly sexualized (there isn't one who doesn't get naked or seminaked).But on the flipside, the protagonists are AMAZING. McAvoy and Fassbender are absolutely brilliant as two very similar men -- charismatic, intelligent, strong-willed -- who become fast friends, but are divided by their different views of human nature. Both actors really explore the bond between their characters, but you can see their differing beliefs slowly infecting it.As for the younger X-Men, they range from excellent (the adorable Nicholas Hoult) to horribly flat (Zo Kravitz), but the one that disappointed me the most was Lawrence as the young Mystique. Lawrence is a sublime actress, but she seems oddly ""off"" here... possibly because of Mystique's rather flat ""teen outcast"" characterization.""X-Men: First Class"" has a rather lightweight plot and some sketchy casting, but is saved by the presence of McAvoy and Fassbender. A fun watch for fans of the X-Men, if you can get past the constant objectification of women.",1459900800,"04 6, 2016",3.0,0

"""Sling Blade"" is an emotionally exhausting picture which establishes Billy Bob Thornton as one of our very best actors, writers, and directors. This story of a mentally handicapped man committed to a mental hospital for a childhood double murder, and his attempt to make it in the outside world, avoids the usual stereotypes about the closed-minded townsfolk and their prejudice against someone like Karl Childers, Thornton's character. Upon his release Childers is given a mechanic's job and befriends a young boy, his widowed mother, and her gay best friend. Unfortunately, the mother's drunken, violent boyfriend - Dwight Yoakam in a dark, effective performance - cannot accept Karl getting in the way of his relationship, and Childers must ultimately defend his new ""family"" the only way he knows how.The tragedy of ""Sling Blade"" is that Childers is a basically gentle soul whose abusive childhood - his father and mother made him live in a shed behind the house - and marginal intelligence have made him unable to function without violence. More importantly, deep down Childers knows this; he knows he cannot function as a free man, and simply cannot protect the ones he loves without violence. The result is one of the most sympathetic characters I have ever seen in a movie.Don't read things into a film that aren't there, but don't ignore the interesting elements that are.

"This is for someone who already knows all of the basic dance step moves and doesn't need to be instructed at an elementary level again, something one wants when seeking a higher level of uninterrupted cardio. What you are learning is new choreography instead and that is easily picked up while having dancing fun. I was doing Tracy Anderson dance workouts but wanted something else for variety and with a litte less high impact. I loved this workout so much that I unfortunately bought Alison Davis's Cardio Dance Express as well and it turns out that they are identical DVDs with different names and picture on the front (!)-- so beware. These types of more advanced dance workouts are hard to find. No one needs to keep re-learning the samba or cha-cha when workout time is limited.  A DVD such at this level is perfect to get a good 30-45 minutes of non-stop cardio alone or before doing other toning exercises. So if anyone has any intermediate to advanced dance DVDs to recommend, it would be greatly appreciated.

"The most significant thing about this flick is Laura Cannon's performance - she was obviously a competent actress who took her role seriously, as well as being much prettier than can be expected in a film of this type.The only problem is that her performance as a rape victim was almost TOO good for a porn movie. She projected the pain and terror a woman would really feel in that situation so well that I started to empathize with her. And that is not a good thing in a porn movie, because you are not turned on if you are made to sympathize with the ""victim"". You want to suspend your own ethical code for a while, and see her as an object, precisely because a normal person can't do that in real life.I hope Laura - or whatever her real name was - managed to break into ""legitimate"" acting.

It also provides history, culture, music, and...well...everything but the smell and taste of this interesting country.Included is Jerusalem to Tel Aviv; Noah to today's fast paced locals; Mediterranean Sea to religious mountain peaks; farms to desert; brides to soldiers; Biblical to 21 Century architecture. The Sea of Galilee from the air is breathtaking. The Dead Sea Scroll site is significant as well as the scenes surrounding the Dead Sea itself. There is so much unexpected color there, the lowest point of the world. You see the 5000 year old Acre (Akko) port, and Masada, and of course, the Old City of Jerusalem. Just too much to list it all. Fantastic helicopter-mounted camera work, which also has unbelievable zoom capability. Awesome footage, like all ""Visions"" DVDs.This DVD provides history & locations related to several religions. ""Visions of Israel"" is perfect for the religious pilgrim that cannot travel to Israel. Also enjoyable is the musical background; both vocal and instrumental music in forms from classical to folk. The narration is educational.A bonus added segment of footage (almost 1/2 hour) includes more music background but no narration, except the written captions of site names.

When he sees Ella, played by Mol, he falls instantly in love with her. The problem is she's married to a lowlife businessman (Ray Liotta, in full scumbag mode). They begin an affair which results in Alan getting disfigured from Liotta's goons and left for dead. Now it's 1987 and Alan is returning for revenge.The dialogue is very cliche heavy, with dreamy declarations of love between Ella and Alan.

"I own many recordings of the ""Flying Dutchman"" including a CD of this staged performance which has, for sometime, been my very favorite recording of the opera. I really believe that this recording captures Simon Estes at his considerable best.  His singing is overwhelming.  This performance proves that he was a MAJOR talent in the operatic firmament.  How unfortunate it was that he did not always maintain this high level of singing in other portrayals.  I feel that if he had maintained this standard of singing, he would now be considered one of opera's greatest bass-baritones of all times.  Anyway, his singing in this performance captures him at his very best-great intonation, loads of controlled power along with the required introspective soft well-controlled singing-and does he ever have stamina sounding as fresh at the close of the opera as he does at its beginning!  Visually, his portrayal of the Dutchman is very sensual indeed-I can see why Senta was so besotted and loony for him (whether he is real or not!).Lizbeth Balsev is a wonderful Senta.  She is able to vocally and thrillingly ride the orchestra when required and tone it all down to sing softly when required.  She portrays Senta's mania very well.  She is visually very believable in the role as well as being able to vocally do anything that Wagner throws at her from the full throttled ""blow them off the stage"" type of singing (with no hint of strain) to the most delicate well-controlled soft ""unworldly"" type of singing.  Brava!The rest of the cast is also great. Salminen is simply awesome-is that voice really coming from a human throat?  Schunk sings the impossible role of Erik wonderfully and powerfully; the best that I've ever heard having no audible problems with its cruel tessitura! (He doesn't crack once as I have heard many other tenors do in this role!)Nelsson whips the Bayreuth orchestra into an effective ""oceanic wild froth""; it is really exciting to hear!  None of the opera seems to drag as in some of the other recordings that I've heard (e.g., the Levine recording especially).The chorus is marvelous contributing much excitement to the opera (the tenors in the chorus are a standout being unbelievably good from sweet soft head tones to full bodied stirring high notes)The score is given (I believe) complete including that marvelously exciting stretta-section after the trio which is usually cut. (Possibly because the singers have worn themselves out with the preceding duet and trio.  Nevertheless, these singers-- almost literally whipped into a frenzy with Balsev popping full throttled high note after high note (while prone and crawling on the floor)--sing it for all its worth bring the scene vocally to a thrilling close; they raise the excitement level to the ""fevered-pitch"" reading on the ""opera excitement measuring machine"" making the hairs on the back of my neck stand tall-WOW!)The production is rather modern; however, it is comprehensible even to someone as unsophisticated as I.In spite of a few audible scenery clunks along with footsteps, the sound is great and the picture is crystal clear in this DVD format.  I'm really thrilled to have a visual to go along with my favorite recording of this thrilling masterpiece.",1118620800,"06 13, 2005",5.0,1
"Director Jim Jarmusch, best known to me for his work in making Ghost Dog - The Way of the Samurai, first worked together with Bill Murray in Coffee and Cigarettes before getting back together two years later to make Broken Flowers.Broken Flowers features Bill Murray acting in a role similarly caught up in the mundane passing of time as was his character in Lost in Translation. Murray plays Don Johnston...with a T...a ""middle aged Don Juan"" with a whose past relationships with women are to be admired. As he says, he was just living his life when one day he receives a mysterious letter which had neither a return address nor a signed name. The letter read that it was from a woman from 20 years into Don's past and that shortly after they went their separate ways she gave birth to a son. Don's son.Winston, Don's sleuth-obsessed neighbor gets involved to discover the origin of the letter. His blueprint involves Don creating a list of possible women from which he will plan an itinerary. The choice, then, is Don's; whether or not to set out on this wild goose chase to find a woman who may or may not have given birth to his child.The movie was good. It was not great, it was not incredible, it was not wonderful. It was good. I think it COULD HAVE BEEN great, incredible and/or wonderful. Something was missing.Winston was the loveable character. It was his role that should have been developed further. He and his family with their relationship to Don could have been used more. Maybe a few less cut scenes to watch a plane take off.I understand that the idea was to let Don embark on an outwardly manifested journey into himself, but so many solo shots of Murray sitting quietly as he learned more about himself made the movie progress too slowly.I know I broke the cardinal rule of movie watching and entered the theater last night with expectation(s) for this film. Granted I had not heard much of the movie itself, only that Murray was great. I will concede this point, but with exceptions. To an extent I will draw a parallel between Bill Murray in Broken Flowers and Tom Hanks in The Terminal. Both men were great in their respective roles, the problem was that maybe the roles themselves needed work. The Terminal was a horrible film, so I will go no further in using the two movies in the same sentence. I said before, Broken Flowers is a good movie.I laughed (maybe too) loudly at many points. That is part of what made the movie difficult for me as I would laugh so hard and then there would be such a long lull before the next laugh. This emphasized some parts of the movie as being slower than I believe they really were upon reflection; the contrast was too great.There were two things that I definitely enjoyed about Jarmusch's direction. One, though it made me a bit nauseous, was his camera shot out Don's driver side window. The shot is right out the window, including the reflection in the side mirror. This shows Don on his journey through his past to maybe find a piece of his future. We watch the world pass by his window then vanish into the horizon. The second technique was the use of basketball hoops. Winston instructed Don to keep an eye out for clues that may indicate which of the women mothered a son. Each neighborhood he travels to shows a basketball hoop. The hoops are used as hope that maybe he is on the right path.I was also fascinated by the newfound desire in a man who had never exhibited any signs of wanting a family of his own to find his son in the face of every 19 year old young man he passed on the street. ...So I guess that was three things I liked....Either go in committed to ""the long haul"" or maybe get antsy in your uncomfortable theater seat, either way the movie is good. Maybe Jim Jarmusch will just let me see his next script ahead of time so we can work in a few more jokes to keep up the intensity. Until then, go see Broken Flowers.

"Lalita (Aishwarya Rai) is one of four daughters in a traditional Indian family. Her cousin's marriage brings family from far and wide. One of the family friends is Balraj (Naveen Andrews, currently on TVs ""Lost"") and his sister, Kiran. Balraj is a barrister in London and all of Lalita's sisters take a second look at him. Balraj has brough his American friend, Will Darcy (Martin Henderson), the heir to a luxury hotel chain, along for the ride. Darcy is immediately drawn to Lalita, but both people are concerned about the culture clash and no small amount of miscommunication keeps them apart.Traveling from Amritsar, a small town in India, to Goa, to London, to Beverly Hills and back to London and Amritsar, ""Bride and Prejudice"", Gurinder Chadha's follow-up to ""Bend It Like Beckham, has a scope that is probably too big for it's own good. Attempting to meld Bollywood musicals and Western dramas with English literature, the film is successful. But it is most successful when the story is anchored to India.Within minutes of the credits, Andrews and every other Indian male at the wedding party bursts into an elaborate, fun to watch dance that is meant to be a sort of mating dance. Then the women, including Lalita and her three sisters joins in. Darcy watches from a balcony above and resists Balraj's attempts to get him to join in. The dance is fun, frenetic and very ""Bollywood"". This dance is also a terrific way to introduce the viewer to the world of Bollywood. Let's face it, most Westerners would probably find a Bollywood musical number at least a little strange. Due to the lack of musicals produced in Hollywood, we just aren't used to watching people spontaneously break out into song. In India, this is apparently hugely popular. Many of their films contain this type of musical interlude.When the film is set in India, the characters interact with Darcy and he is the outsider. When it moves to London and Beverly Hills, Lalita and her family become the outsiders. This shift, while necessary from a dramatic viewpoint, makes them appear slightly oafish and too comical. It really diminishes the intelligence of this Indian family.The idea of mixing Bollywood-style musical numbers with western storytelling is not a new one. There have been a couple of less successful examples in the last few years. ""Predjudice"" falls short when the story moves to the West. As Darcy and Lalita are walking along the beach in Santa Monica, a chorus of church choir singers suddenly appears, singing. A couple of lifeguards and a few surfers also join in. This is a novel idea, but the number is not as large or elaborately choreographed as it's Bollywood cousins and it falls short.""Bride and Prejudice"" works very hard to try to blend all of the various styles and influences that are at work here, and it succeeds, for the most part. If you are unable to overlook the less imaginative, slower, more serious Western influences, you might actually enjoy a quick glimpse into a culture that deserves more attention.",1113264000,"04 12, 2005",3.0,0

"Okay, while Europe has had this monumental classic on Blu-ray for more than a decade, it took Kino Lorber far too long to give us this 'remastered' Blu-ray: advertised as a 4K scan from Studio Canal. Too much gate weave and image wobble. The opening credits are a nightmare. The rest of the movie is inconsistently rendered at best. Colors are better than on any of the Euro-editions. But honestly, they did a 4K scan and didn't check it for instability?!?!? Whose running the show? Helen Keller?  Bottom line: with a superb pedigree and outstanding performances from Kate Hepburn, Peter O'Toole, Anthony Hopkins, and, Timothy Dalton this should have been a highly recommended 'must own' disc. It's not. Will it ever get revisited again? In a perfect world, it most definitely should!  Bottom line: total fail and a real waste of your money.

"I went through a random song playback on my iPod when ""Together in Electric Dreams"" started playing. Then I realized how much I loved this movie and how it touched my heart (yeah I was only 13 years old in 1984) when I saw it.So I checked everywhere (netflix, blockbuster.com, amazon) for the DVD and I couldn't find it (I felt really old by this time). And I started to read the reviews and I realized there are at least 100 reviewers who felt the same thing.This movie is such a cult classic of the 80s that it MUST be released on DVD. Great music, great characters, and great storyline despite its cheesiness.

"This breathless, horrifying film is a great shocker and deliciously malicious thriller. Every second is a haunting one, drawing the viewer into the story, until the viewer can concentrate on nothing else. Bette Davis  (in the most bizzare role of what can be said as an EXTREMELY bizzare but  illustrious career) plays Jane Hudson, a sixty-year-old has-been child star  with a fragile, six-year-old mind. She lives with her sister Blanche  (marvelously played by Joan Crawford), who was believed to be crippled by  Jane. Blanche was a famous actress of Hollywood's Golden Years, but was  supposedly crippled by her jealous sister at the peak of her success. The  two live in a decaying, thirties-style house in Hollywood. When Blanche's  popularity is revived by her films being shown on television, her drunken  sister decides to revive her own kiddie act. In the process, she  maliciously cuts off her sister from the outside world, throwing out her  telephone, serving her dead birds and rats (two of the film's most  memorable scenes), and eventually tying  and gagging her crippled sister,  leaving her in a dark room to die. Bette Davis and Joan Crawford are said  never to have gotten along at all, and in these scenes it is particularly  unnerving to observe this truth on film. But most memorable is the  anticlimatic scene in which it is finally revealed just how Blanche was  crippled, and Jane's mental balance snaps. But for all the grotesque,  haunting two hours of movie, and sickening truths revealed at film's end,  the hardening finality of the film's final shot determines that the  question asked at the movie's beginning could never and will never be  answered: ""What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?"".",960595200,"06 10, 2000",5.0,1
