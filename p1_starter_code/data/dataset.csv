"I happened upon this on Netflix, (never heard of it before). I did manage to make it through the movie - and what a cast - one star after another. However, this does not save the movie from being dull and very, very slow. The acting is superb, the movie is pretty boring and predictable.",1437523200,"07 22, 2015",3.0,0
"Reeves seemed to be on depressants the entire movie--the hostages on the bus were far more entertaining and talented than he ever was in this film.  I'm still aghast at how utterly terrible Reeves' acting was.  It defies all comparison, explanation, and comprehension.I felt immensely sorry for Bullock, having to kiss him and all.

"This movie came out when I was a senior in high school, and it was the theme of our prom that year. I remember that I went to the theater 5 times to see it, plus once more at the drive-in. The scenery, the sets, the lavish costumes, the music, oh the romance! I love this movie from start to finish. That said, it's not a movie for everyone. Most guys I know hate it. I guess it's one of those movies that you either love or hate, and I don't think reading anyone else's review is going to change your mind. If you haven't seen it, give it a chance!",1185840000,"07 31, 2007",5.0,1

"2 1/2 stars. i usually buy dvds if they have good reviews in the type of genre i like. Anyway, the reviews are over-rated. The acting is GREAT from the key actors. A couple of the goofy idiot cops should have been replaced. But the directing and the writing are WAY OFF. This show would really appeal gangbangers n ppl like dat. Eg. The show has a curtain lingo, if you arnt 'in the life' you probably won't get alot of whats goin on. The writers have written it in away that details of the show that are supposed to be obvious can easily be over looked.This show goes for 1 hr on its own, on dvd. no shows do that. this may be an issue with getting a time-slot. I bought this on special for $15 au. Which is about $10 US atm. No way would i pay $60 US, for a 13 episode show. ha",1234742400,"02 16, 2009",3.0,0

"It's been three years since we got a real Jim Carrey comedy. The last being ""Me, Myself & Irene"". While Jim tried to expand his talents with more straight films like ""The Truman Show"", ""Man On The Moon"", and ""The Majestic"", fans were starting to miss what they first fell for Jim in the first place. Comedy. This movie is a relief to those of us who have been waiting to see Jim return to comedy. However, this isn't the manic, over the top frenzy kind of comedy that made Jim famous for in the 90's with fare like ""Ace Ventura"" and ""Dumb And Dumber"". Sure,  some of the zaniness and physical aspect of it is there, but it's not as much as usual. Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a field correspondent for the local Buffalo news station who usually covers the more heartwarming and human stories that normally end the newscasts. Things aren't going his way. He wants an anchor job that he eventually loses to a smarmy co-worker(Steve Carell), a dog that urinates all over the apartment, and on top of that, he gets beat up. On the upside, Bruce does have a great girlfriend named Grace, who is played by Jennifer Aniston and looks really good in this film. After Bruce's whining and complaining to God over his less than stellar life, the big man himself(played with the right amount of presence and magic by Morgan Freeman) pays Bruce a visit and offers Bruce his powers while he is on vacation. This is where the fillm starts to pick up speed and starts to let Carrey let loose and have fun. Naturally, as anyone would, Bruce lets his powers get to him and abuses them for his own purposes. When he tries to make some good in the world with his newfound abilities, well, chaos abounds. This isn't exactly an inventive idea. How many times have we seen a film where someone gets powers, or gets a second chance, or gets to trade places with somebody?. Lots of times. So, while it isn't exactly a revolutionary idea, the film rises above all others because those movies didn't have Jim Carrey. He really brings Bruce to life in the beginning of the film by making him seem like a loveable loser in a slump with life. Some say he was very unlikeable, but he was exactly the opposite. He was likeable. He was having a bad time. Not once did I not like, or feel, for the character. Carrey was able to play it with a straight face during these times, and he didn't look like he was always on the verge of a laugh or saying something funny. As some critics have stated. What was surprising, and somewhat disappointing, was how Carrey was more restrained than you would of thought. There are moments of silliness and some old Carrey schtick, but he doesn't go over the top like the good 'ol days in the 90's. His comedic performance in the film was a balance between the physical comedy of ""Liar Liar"", but with the heart and solidness of his ""The Truman Show"" era. One would of wished it had been kicked into higher gear, but it is good nonetheless. Aniston does what she can with the usual ""I've been dating this guy for 5 years and I want a wedding and kids"" girlfriend role, but she manages to bring some heart and emotion to the predictable supporting role. Morgan Freeman was a nice bit of casting as the almighty one himself. His scenes are not very long, but he really brings it and makes the most of his scenes. ""Jag"" star Catherine Bell appears in the film as well, as does character actor Phillip Baker Hall as Bruce's boss. Steve Carell as the slimy co-worker gets one of the funniest scenes in the movie by having a breakdown on the set thanks to Bruce. The extra features on the disc are a lot of fun. Some of the outtakes and deleted scenes are hilarious and you would wish that some of them had ended up in the finished product. As some other reviews had stated, the commercial ads on this disc are annoying and they don't allow you to skip through them. However, I found that if you hit 'menu' on your control, it will come up and you can get through those annoying ads. So, this film is a lot of fun and it has a really nice feeling to it. It has heart, it has emotion, and it's funny. It is a pleasant and enjoyable film to kill a few hours. Jim Carrey is really good, and if this is the place he's at now in his career, then it's a mighty fine place to be.",1070582400,"12 5, 2003",3.0,0

"For a feel-good experience, this movie fits the bill. It's romantic comedy blended with a little fantasy (time-travel), and in many ways, is also a love letter to Manhattan. And in these times, that's most welcome! The only negative to me is that Meg Ryan, while no doubt a very talented actress, has done this kind of role many times before, and maybe it's time for her to try other character-types. As for Hugh Jackman, this movie more than makes up for ""Swordfish""! I had to keep reminding myself that this was the same man who played Wolverine in ""X-Men"".

"OK, that's a little harsh.  One star is probably not too many for a movie that isn't really a ""movie"" in the sense of having a coherent plot, credible dialogue, minimal acting skills, etc. ""Roller Boogie"" would have made a perfect Charlie's Angels episode -- in fact, it did, when Jaclyn, Farrah and Kate (or their stunt doubles) donned their four-wheel, suede-booted skates and chased the bad guys down Venice Beach.But the Angels were the Angels; everything they did was in the greater service of looking good, acting very little, and trying not to laugh their way through ridiculous plots. ""Roller Boogie"", on the other hand, offers us Queen of the B's Linda Blair surrounded by a bevy of nonactors, a raft of horrendous disco songs (this stuff makes the Bee Gees sound like great art), and endless choreographed disco-on-skates numbers.

"I loved watching this video and was sad to find that I'd finally come to the end of it.  Which is why I then went and downloaded The Anna Nicole Show Season II from [...].  I waited a couple of months to watch it in its entirety, but by then I could no longer watch Anna, Howard and Daniel, since two of the three had passed on by that time.  Sad doesn't describe the feeling, especially after getting to know all of them in such an intimate way  (and this is not too much of an exaggeration).The video is just hilariously, ridiculously funny.  I laughed so hard I really did have tears rolling from my eyes.One of the funniest episodes was Anna going house hunting with Howard and the Realtor.  This is the episode where she opens the fridge in one of the houses she's touring and helps herself to whatever's in there.AND this is the one where she squeezes into the tub in that same house.There's another episode in the Season I set in which Anna, Howard and one of their entourage are at a kinky sex toy shop.  Nothing there is lewd or controversial (e.g., no chains or bondage type ""toys""), just silly, funny odds and ends.  Anna is wildly funny in this particular segment, esp. when she is looking at the various male organs.  You just have to be there and, I promise, if you buy this video you will feel as though you are there with Anna, Howard, Daniel, Kimmy, Frank, and Le Famous Bobby Trendy.  Oh, and how could I forget the one and only Sugar Pie?It gets a little bawdy in certain parts; for instance, the Christmas Party pushes past the line of propriety more than a little bit, but, on balance this compilation of episodes from Season I is worth it as long as you believe that some of it is just Anna being a great actress ---- and that she is.

"Simply put- this is the best, affectingly told gay romance films to be released over the past few years. If you walk away from this one and not moved by this impressive debut movie by Michael Akers- you're the Tin Man in ""The Wizard of Oz""- no heart! (heh heh) This movie will win you over on many levels- characters, plot, direction, and cinematography.Do not rate the merits and ""final product"" of this film against bigger budgeted gay-themed films currently available, many of which disappoint with their ""been there; done that"" plots and stereotypes such as ""The Trip"" and ""Friends & Family."" You will be comparing ""apples to oranges"" and miss the message of this simple film. ""Gone..."" successfully shows the honest portryal of two gay men in their growing feelings as a couple in a honest but tasteful manner. In most main-stream ""Hollywood"" gay-theme films, the writers and directors seem more afraid not to offend and dilute the actors' characters and actions so you walk away from the film thinking you saw two ""straight buddies,"" not two gay men in genuine affection for each other. Mr. Akers has taken a much needed ""next step"" in breaking that pattern with this film.I definitely recommend this one for your DVD collection over many other run-of-the-mill gay-themed movies available. It is also fun, entertaining, and informative to watch playing the commentary track with Michael Akers and Matthew Montgomery.",1075852800,"02 4, 2004",5.0,1

"Energetic cast from Stephen Sommer's 1999 original returns completely intact with the new addition of Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz's son. Taking place a few years after the original adventure, this episode finds our heroes taking on the vicious Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) once again, plus the added threat of the reincarnation of his eternal love Anuksunamun (Patricia Velasquez, whose extended role reveals a shaky and moderately-talented actress). The two groups are racing against time to be present at the reawakening of the centuries-dead Scorpion King (WWF Champ The Rock), who will raise up his army and take over the world with his evil powers. The adventerous scenes are even more plentiful than they were in the original, though thankfully Sommers' direction isn't as heavy-handed as it was the first time around, thanks mostly to much better production design and a lighter score by Alan Silvestri. The film's only drawback is an overemphasis on computer-generated images that after a while start to feel a little awkward. Weisz is even more charming this time around than she was the last time, plus now she can fight like no martial arts champion can.",1001894400,"10 1, 2001",3.0,0

I would have liked to know more, like why did they think they were vampires, why did they follow this lame guy around, etc. Do not watch this movie, I suspect reading about the real story would be more interesting.",1066521600,"10 19, 2003",1.0,-1

"*SPOILERS*I am a fan of science fiction, and I especially like BAD science fiction, by which I mean movies like ""Plan 9"", which is a laugh riot (unintentionally) no matter how many times you see it. I did a little research on this movie after watching it, and discovered that the entire budget for physical production (live actors and the crew to film them) came to only $500,000, and the special effects budget was $20 million. That explains a lot.So, the main reason I hate this movie is that it wasn't bad enough. The acting is awful, and the script is one of those where you'll be saying the next line before the actor does. But the special effects are impressive.The ending, where the main character (Eric Balfour) and his girlfriend (Scottie Thompson) are being sucked up into the spaceship to have their brains removed, is really finger-down-the-throat time. As they fly up into the ship, they manage to embrace and kiss. It would have been all right if it ended there... but what happens in the ship after that is one of the most hilariously maudlin, oh-no-they-didn't scenes I've witnessed in any movie of whatever genre.My recommendation: skip this, or at least make a drinking game out of it with friends.

It's a shame - since the audience could not have been less prepared for the twisted ending.

This was a visually interesting film and the music was sometimes good. Yet it seemed flat. For example there were so many scenes when intelligent people would have been talking with each other about their situations and feelings and these two and often the wife just sort of looked at each other mysteriously. It just did not click.Even less sophisticated people would have talked more. In this sense and others the characters were just not developed.  One got the impression that the filmmakers were over their heads in trying to get into the characters.

Chris Tucker's character is just as annoying as before, although, he was bearable in the first two.  This one was a whole new level of annoyance.  Jackie Chan seemed tired.  He really should quit making these movies.  Don't get me wrong, I like Jackie Chan.  I think he is extremely talented and really brings alot to action movies.  But, when paired with someone who doesn't support him on screen, he loses that appeal.My suggestion is to pass on this one and remember the Rush Hours for what they were.

"To give credit where due: this movie goes beyond the simplistic formulas of the usual superhero movies, and attempts to deal with SOCIAL issues, rather than just individual ones.  For example, clearly avoiding nuclear holocaust is preferable to merely cleaning up streetgangs who happened to hurt a friend.And it tries to get beyond the rigid dualism of GOOD vs. EVIL, by intimating that most of the times things are not so clear.  For example, Veidt is a liar and a murderer, but does it in a greater cause--which really is a greater cause, and not merely self-serving.Also, it presents a lot of characters, and they go through changes--all of which adds interest.  Oddly, Rorschach is the most interesting, and the best actor.However, the take on social issues, while laudable in principle, is lame in practice.  The movie is still hobbled by its ""the political is always personal"" outlook.  For example, when Veidt and Rorschach finally face off, no resolution is possible except for one of them to blow the other up.As in all superhero movies, the special effects are more important than the people.  You don't really know if Billy Crudup is affectless because the character demands it, or if he just can't act.All in all, this picture is unsettling and not very instructive or fun.I'm glad I saw it.

"Poor Little Rich Girl has truly gone missing from this DVD adventure. My favorite ""Shirley"" film is ""Poor LIttle Rich Girl"" with a great story of how a very rich Shirley decided to go on a vacation and see how other people live, but ends up on the radio. It is no where to be found in this DVD collection! Poor Little Rich Girl has amazing, difficult choreography with Shirley, Alice Faye and Jack Haley at the end of the film. Also, at one point in the film, Shirley's ""Dad"" lifts her up to carry her and the actor mistakenly pulls up a bit too much of Shirley's dress and it shows the real Shirley at such a young age being very modest, looking around and down to see if there is too much for all to see. Director probably left that part in to show how real Shirley always was. Also, amazing songs and dances throughout. Jack Haley, the Tin Man in ""Wizard"", great warmth, fun to watch.

"I caught this on Sundance and was mesmerized for 4 hours! I always liked Tom and band.. the thing is he is so deceptively a talented songwriter that it was easy to take him for granted. Forgive me Tom for doing that! After learning so much about him as a man, and a kind, sweet man at that, for some reason that helped me appreciate his poetry and musical skills all the more.  The movie shows his seedling talent and how he persisted and learned and grew, and also kept a strong core of optimism and delight at how things in his life unfolded. Beautifully done camera and wonderful clips of young Tom and band. Absolutely worth every penny, and even if you think you are not a big TP fan, get it anyway if you like any rock music at all, you will be converted, as I was. I am now in the process of buying every thing this brilliant man has ever done.And now we will be treated to TP and HB halftime at the Superbowl.

I have seen just about every tv and movie adaptation, and this is my favorite version of Sense and Sensibility.  The acting and cinematography are a delight.If you are a purist, it seems that Emma Thompson or Ang Lee chose to make Edward Ferras (played by Hugh Grant)a bit more sympathetic in the movie than he is in the book.  However, I found this to be thoroughly forgivable and not distracting.This movie sticks closely to the Austen plot, is historically accurate, and has fascinating characters brought to life by extremely talented actors.

"I was never a fan of TNG and in fact, I found it to be a poor imitation of the original in every way except special effects. It did have its moments, however, and none better than Yesterday's Enterprise. It is a brilliant episode, with a story that involves time travel, war and peace, love and loss.The best thing in this episode is also the best in the whole TNG series...Patrick Stewart. He consistently rises above the material and gives a commanding performance as Picard. For me, he is the only great character in TNG and especially in this episode, where he is on a ship of war, not one of peace with the kids running around, which I always felt detracted from the realism of a future exploring vessel.The weakest thing in this episode is Guinen (sp) played by Whoopi Goldberg. She seems so ill at ease when reciting her lines it is hard to believe this is an Oscar winner. The character is bizarre and almost too convenient at times and, quite frankly, boring.In the best scene, when she confronts Picard about the decision to send Enterprise-C, we get to see them both together. It is a polarizing scene because on the one end we have Stewart giving his best scene in the series and he is acting with Goldberg, who has a raspy voice and almost no conviction within her role. I often think of this and a similar one in First Contact, the latter being superior because Stewart had a much better actress to raise the level of the scene.So it is not a perfect episode, it is not as good as the best episodes of TOS, but it is still outstanding and very deserving of the accolades it has received. I also find it kind of sad because this is the one episode I watch and I think 'what might have been' because this was a darker, grittier future and one that would have been far more compelling than the politically correct one we were given with episodes written like Saturday morning cartoons. Yeah, the later seasons of TNG were better but still too restrained for good drama and storytelling.",1243814400,"06 1, 2009",5.0,1

"What you have here is the entire first season of one of America's most famous and well-liked television shows from the 70's--""Barney Miller"". All thirteen episodes are here--digitally remastered!!!!!Looking at ""Barney Miller"" today,it's not hard to see why this show still acquires good respect. Set in the 12th precinct of the New York City police department,the episodes find the precinct's officers(Hal Linden's character of Captain Barney Miller,Abe Vigoda's character of Detective Phil Fish,Gregory Sierra's character of Detective Chano Amenguale,Max Gail's character of Detective Stan 'Wojo' Wojchiehowitz,and even though they weren't ""official cast members"" at the time,Ron Glass' and Jack Soo's characters of Detective Ron Harris and Detective Sergeant Nick Yemana)caught up in their own work and the chaos of their own personal lives(most notably Miller and Fish--that's when the humor really hits hard!). The remarkable thing about ""Barney Miller"" is how it never runs low on humor and how the show's actors execute the humor to the fullest--with a good serious edge also. The ""drama"" in some of the episodes of ""Barney Miller"" take on an appropriate amount of dominance with richly executed talent. It makes the episodes of ""Barney Miller"" that are to be found here very remarkable and worthwhile--keeping the entertainment coming.As for the packaging of the first season of ""Barney Miller"",things here are in good hand. As already mentioned,all thirteen episodes are digitally remastered. On top of that,you get TV-ographies of the cast of the first season of ""Barney Miller""(with the exceptions of Barbara Barrie and Gregory Sierra),the theatrical trailer for ""Anger Management""(yes,the 2003 Adam Sandler/Jack Nicholson flick,even if this DVD was released a year after the release of ""Anger Management""),television trailers(one trailer for most old television shows from the era that ""Barney Miller"" was on that are now on DVD,the other trailer for both shows from that era and ""recent"" shows such as ""Mad About You"" and ""King of Queens"",both the shows and the DVDS of them getting equal representation),as well as two booklets(one with info on the episodes that are to be found on this DVD,and one that advertises the DVDS that the first disc of this set advertise). I find it dissapointing that the special feautures give no representation of ""Barney Miller"" and no recognition to either Barbara Barrie or Gregory Sierra(the same actor who played Julio Fuentes on ""Sanford and Son"" and Lt. Lou Rodriguez on ""Miami Vice"",I might add). However,with the special feautures having a memorable gem(who could ever forget ""Anger Management""??!!)and offering a good look at television(70's plus)in a nutshell,I can't complain too bad.Overall,a good way for ""Barney Miller"" fans to enjoy the first season.

First 20th Century Fox released ""The Raquel Welch Collection"" box set, then Warner Home Video gave us ""The Last Of Sheila"" and now ""The Wild Party"", probably one of Miss Welch's best films! And thanks to the fine folks at MGM we have the ORIGINAL, UN-CUT version not the version originally released by AIP back in the 70s. And what a glorious film it is! Rocky is just great as Queenie, the mistress of Jolly Grimm (James Coco), a washed up silent movie comedian vainly attempting to make a comeback into pictures. She is endearing and sexy as his tender young lover, and the song she sings (""SINGAPORE SALLY"") is a real treat!Picture and sound are both quite good on this disc and the extra's include the original trailer and a short interview with the director, James Ivory.So, if you like Miss Welch (and how can anyone not???), check this disc out. You'll love it! Now if only MGM will release ""Kansas City Bomber"" and Paramount put out ""Hannie Caulder"", I'd be a really happy camper! - George Bauch,",1089590400,"07 12, 2004",5.0,1

"I got this video hoping the production team had returned to the days of glory of ""Airplane"". Indeed, the movie has some great gags and is absolutely ruthless in making fun out of everything you can think of... This is ""no mercy"" humor at its best. However, a few of the gags don't work, and the film overall doesn't have the same rhythm found in ""Airplane"" and ""Airplane 2"". My disappointment came at the last third of the film, when the producers start leaving comedy aside and begin delivering a clear ""support our troops, no matter what"" message, which I find questionable, to say the least. The movie turns into propaganda, and loses the comedy angle it started out with. So I give it 5 stars for the first half, 1 star for the last third.",1234051200,"02 8, 2009",3.0,0

I usually attempt to be generous even when offering a bad review as I do not believe mean spirited commentary is useful but this movie was the worst.The script/dialogue had to have been written by a pre-teen.  The inclusion of several well known actors did nothing to enhance the script as their performances were stereotypical and uninspired.  One point of interest...I do believe the banjo player was actually the boy (now grown) who played in the famous dueling banjo scene from Deliverance.  His eyes are the same and age seems correct.,1349913600,"10 11, 2012",1.0,-1

"When I watched ""Boca a Boca"" (English captions) twenty years ago, it was the first I realized that Oscar-winner Javier Bardem (""No Country for Old Men"") could do comedy. He plays an unemployed actor who has his bike stolen while delivering a pizza. He has been auditioning (casting directors are a heartless breed!) in vain for months so he decides to go back home. His agent begs him to stay in Barcelona for just one more audition for a ""role of a lifetime!"" that will happen in two weeks.Director Manual Gmez Pereira swings his actors between farce, romance and violence (yeah, a few gunshots) as a hired killer tries to ""off"" one of our hero's clients. Wait until you see where he ends up working!Our cast:  * Javier Bardem (""The Sea Inside"") is Victor, ambitious but broke. A casting director has demeaned him one too many times with a ridiculous audition ('Make 'em Laugh' from ""Singin' in the Rain"" ...in English!) and he just wants to go home. Now he needs to survive for two more weeks.  * Aitana Sanchez-Gijon (""The Machinist"") Gorgeous Amanda knows all the right moves and Victor loves every one of them! But wait a minute...whose wife is she?  * Josep Maria Flotats (This was the last movie he made) Bill is Victor's customer. Or is he Ricardo, Amanda's husband? Maybe it's safer back in the closet!With an R rating, expect  implied sexual situations, some profanity and a gunshot or two. I have re-watched this comedy several times over the years and I am always happy to see Bardem in a comedy. He has done award-winning roles many times since he made this one, but they are all so GRIM! Each new plot twist is a surprise to Victor and to us, but it all gets sorted out...kinda....I really like this one!",1467504000,"07 3, 2016",5.0,1

"As many reviewers have pointed out, ""The Princess and the Frog"" is Disney's welcome return to the traditional hand-drawn-style animation. What is more important is that the film is helmed by Ron Clements and John Musker, a director team responsible for two great Disney animations - ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin"" - and, well, less impressive ""Treasure Planet."" ""The Princess and the Frog"" marks the ""comeback"" of the creator pair since the ill-fated sci-fi action adventure, and their latest work, though not perfect, is entertaining enough to remind us of the glorious days of Disney animation.Tiana (voice by Anika Noni Rose, ""Dreamgirls"") is a hard-working girl dreaming of one day owning a restaurant in New Orleans. One night she encounters a talking frog begging for just one kiss. This is actually Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos), a spoiled prince magically turned into a frog by voodoo master Dr. Facilier (Keith David). She does, reluctantly though, like in a fairy tale she once read - which is only the beginning of adventures and a romance for Tiana and the prince.Though ""The Princess and the Frog"" is an enjoyable tale with colorful designs and talented cast, it doesn't quite reach the height of classic ""Little Mermaid"" as the film lacks two major characteristics: a compelling story and memorable music. The story starts out interesting with a few unexpected turn of events, but it sags a bit in the middle part. The musical part (songs penned by Randy Newman) is good, but not as great as Alan Menken/Howard Ashman's original songs like joyful ""Under the Sea.""What you have instead is Jazz-age New Orleans and everything associated with the city turned into animation - the swamp, the French Quarter, Mardi Gras and Tiana's Cajun cookbook. The goofy trumpet-playing croc steals every scene from the two leads. Maybe not as great as ""The Lion King,"" but ""The Princess and the Frog"" is a pleasant fantasy tale.",1268784000,"03 17, 2010",4.0,1

"DAIBOSATSU TOUGE (THE SWORD OF DOOM / DAIBOSATSU [MOUNTAIN] PASS)  Slasher Body Count Extravaganza!Rating = **Director:  Kihachi OkamotoDVD1966Film = two (2) stars; choreography = 2.5 stars; editing = 3.0 (three) stars.  Director Kihachi Okamoto's  melodramatic, confusing mash up depicting mid 19th Century samurai life and times.  Most actors and actresses are made up to look too much alike (name tags would really help!) and inter-scene continuity is often nonexistent (what is plotted in a scene may never be executed in later ones).  The Director appears to have employed EVERY available samurai stuntman in Kyoto (and a number of semi-pros to boot!) who keep reappearing and dying over and over again.  Lead actor (Tatsuya Nakadai) plays your standard-issue samurai sociopath whose character alternates between brooding and slashing.  (Toshiro Mifune makes a light-weight cameo appearance.)  Slashing scenes (including a prolonged attack on bamboo curtains [cheap props apparently substituting for mirrors?] by the lead protagonist) are way too long and, ultimately, become comic (intentional?) and boring. Choreography needs some work.  Stuntmen in scenes of 20 (or more) sword swingers are often shown slashed and dying without being touched by a sword (a sword is just waived in their general direction!).  Cinematography (wide screen, black and white) and scene lighting are fine.  Same for sound, score, and subtitles.  Skip this one unless you are seriously suffering from insomnia.

The social conventions, the rigid moral, the narrow state of mind of both parents, plus the accented religious fervor will be creating an increasing state of boiling point with unexpected consequences.James Woods as the weakest, dominated husband through his unwarranted behavior added his little grain of sand in this brutal nightmare, and Kathleen Turner as the implacable mother are splendid.

"I'm not a gorehound and only occasionally watch slasher flicks, but I'm a huge fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise, which started in 1980 with the mega-success of the first film. My appreciation has nothing to do with nostalgia since I didn't become a fan until I was well into adulthood when I saw 1985's ""Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning"" on TV one night in the early 2000s. I think I like these movies because they typically involve young adults in a fun camp-type environment in the woods, which naturally stirs fond youthful memories (not that I'm that old); the presence of an unstoppable killer -- who increasingly becomes an infernal monster -- just adds an air of danger and suspense to the dramedy and adventure. Add scores of gorgeous females and various filming locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining franchise that has yet to end. It's the camp-like settings of most of the series and the unstoppable malevolent force that is Voorhees -- Jason, his mother, or anyone under his diabolic spell -- that especially sets ""Friday the 13th"" apart from similar franchises.The first two films are serious in tone with the expected antics of youths on vacation in the woods, but the franchise introduced a campy element with Part III, which pretty much plagues the rest of the series with the exception of maybe IV, VII (maybe VIII) and the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway.Released in 1993, ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday"" is arguably the oddest entry in the series, which isn't much of a surprise since three of the last four installments were departures from the typical Friday formula -- Part V, VII (which features a Carrie-like character) and especially VIII (which switches the setting from Crystal Lake to a cruise ship and the big city).The prologue shows Jason back at Crystal Lake. How'd he get back there after the events in Part VIII? The ending of that movie didn't show Jason completely destroyed, so we must assume that he made it out of the sewers of Manhattan and simply gravitated back to his familiar stomping grounds. Anyway, the opening is excellent and highlighted by one of the most stunning females in the entire series, Julie Michaels as Agent Marcus (which is saying a lot in light of the series having the best line of women of ANY movie franchise, except for Part VII, which was sub-par in this department).Jason winds up in the morgue in Youngstown, Ohio, and the film takes an interesting twist reminiscent of the 80's cult film ""The Hidden."" Other bizarre additions to the Jason Voohees mythos include a magic sword, a strange ""Jason-Finder General"" character and the revelation of the only way the monster can be killed and resurrected. I don't mind the change of pace as the series was hackneyed after 8 films in 10 years from 1980-89 (albeit still entertaining). Besides, there are enough typical Friday-isms to please fans of the series, for instance the entire camp sequence and the prologue.Some object on the grounds that Jason is supposedly a misunderstood manchild and this movie changes that. The only films fitting that model are Parts II, XI and the 2009 remake. Parts I, V, VI, VII, and VIII were more in line with the idea of Jason as a force of darkness & evil -- the curse on Crystal Lake or whatever. And Parts III and IV had him killing a pregnant girl, psychologically torturing the heroine, and attempting to kill a boy after slaying his mother, so he wasn't exactly Lenny from ""Of Mice and Men"" as these critics maintain. Face it, although Jason may have been an innocent deformed child at one time, the seed of evil (possibly a demonic spirit) entered into his heart at some point and he increasingly became a hideous infernal monster and you have to give this entry credit for trying to fill in the bones with corpse flesh, whether you accept these revelations or not.Unfortunately the final act goes so over-the-top with the action and horror shenanigans that the movie becomes cartoonish and laughable. Take, for instance, the fight between the deputy and Steven (or whatever his name is). As such, ""Jason Goes to Hell"" is one of my least favorite in the series, along with Parts III and VII. Nevertheless, it's still an entertaining and worthy installment in the series.Besides the awe-inspiring Agent Marcus in the prologue, we get a couple of cute campers, Deborah and Alexis, with Deborah (Michelle Clunie) particularly shining. There's also Jessica, who turns out to be the main protagonist, her mom (the goddess Erin Gray from ""Buck Rogers"") and Vicki from the restaurant. Needless to say, great job on the babe front.For those who care (I don't) this entry seriously ups the ante in the horrific gore factor.As far as locations go, ""JGTH"" goes back to Southern Californ in the tradition of Parts III, IV and V.Many people find these films scary and shocking and they do have some creepy aspects and jump scares, but -- with the exception of the 2009 reboot -- I don't find them particularly scary. They're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always fun & entertaining, but not very scary. In fact, I usually bust out laughing at the inevitable death scenes.BOTTOM LINE: ""Jason Goes to Hell"" gets props for its radical departure from the Friday formula, even while containing obvious Friday-isms -- the youths, the babes, Crystal Lake and so on. But the final act spins out of control with quasi-horror zaniness and becomes a joke. Still, any movie that features Agent Marcus and Deborah can't be all bad, lol.The film runs 87 minutes.GRADE: C+ or B-",1408320000,"08 18, 2014",3.0,0

"I have a theory that near the end of a successful show these days, the ""money producers"" pull all the more talented writers onto new projects and leave ""stock"" writers to finish up the show (that already has an insured audience) in any plodding, insipid way they see fit. BSG Seasons 4 and 4.5 serve as strong evidence for this unfortunate practice.The first episodes of ""Caprica,"" or whatever other projects the ""good"" writers were redirected to, will be good television. I've had quite enough though, won't be fooled again, and won't be watching. It will be a long time before I spend time following another television show, as this treatment has killed many of my favorites over the last several years.As I trudged through these final BSG shows on DVD, the distress of the actors at being shortchanged of good material was visible and palpable in their performances, as most of the beloved characters became paper-thin, uninteresting fractions of their previous charm. Unlike any of the previous seasons, I found myself watching most of 4 and 4.5 on high speed, and still yawned.The edgy intelligent plots and plot devices are replaced with the most superficial tabloid level metaphysics imaginable in the final episodes, are we really watching BSG? or a rehash of ""Touched by an Angel?"" Truly a thumb in the eye to the faithful who gave this series its popularity through word-of-mouth raving over the first two seasons. As the audience, we have a vote in these matters, just avoid any further product generated by these people.Simple choice, join me won't you?",1252108800,"09 5, 2009",2.0,-1

"This film should be rented or watched on television before you decide whether to purchase a copy of it.Both Steve Buscemi and Sienna Miller (especially Miller) are among the finest contemporary actors - so it is almost always a pleasure to watch their work.  However, this film consists primarily of over an hour of improbable and sophomoric dialogue between Pierre (Buscemi), a failed, morally-flawed (yet self-righteous) journalist and Katya (Miller), a self-absorbed, manipulative actress who, alternatively, pities and preys upon the unlucky Pierre.  Through a series of interchanges between the characters, we learn (over and over) that they peddle fiction to their respective audiences and, at times, to themselves - but this is easy to pick up during the first ten minutes of the film.  The rest of the film seems intent on exploring how many ways this basic message can be delivered and redelivered.The majority of the interchanges between Pierre and Katya take place in Katya's bohemian apartment, so the film - especially with its minimalist camera work and limited space - often creates the feeling of an intimate stage play.  This would be fine if the writing allowed the characters to expand beyond those limited confines and become interesting.  However, both Miller and Buscemi (who also directed)are repeatedly forced to try to ""emotionally charge"" the alternatively petty and ""heavy"" dialogue that is aimed at showing, as Warhol would have put it, that each character is, in his or her own way, ""deeply superficial"": Imagine two actors forced to take a really good five-minute Tennessee Williams scene and stretch it out for over an hour.  Mid-way through the film (or sooner), you will probably stop caring.The silver lining in this otherwise forgettable film is the incredible range of Miller and Buscemi's mastery of quirky character. For me, this aspect of the film made it worth viewing - but only once.",1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2.0,-1

"Akira Kurosawa directed my favorite film, ""Shichinin no samurai.""  When I was teaching Honors World Literature I would show the film to my students in between their reading of Homer's ""Iliad"" and Cervantes's ""Don Quixote"" as part of a trilogy on the nature of heroism.  Whenever I would teach a course on movies I would screen ""Rashomon,"" and if I taught ""King Lear"" to a class they would see ""Ran.""  If I had ever gotten around to teaching ""MacBeth"" I would have shown them ""Throne of Blood.""  Consequently, I have taken advantage of any and all opportunities to advance the cinematic gospel of Akira Kurosawa.This 2001 documentary about ""Kurosawa"" combines a chronological look at the director's life offering biographical insights into his films with some critical explications of his work.  The latter is relatively limited and while I would have liked to have seen more cinematic analysis we do have a whole series of Criterion Edition DVDs of Kurosawa's film with superb commentary tracks by knowledgeable film critics.  There are also almost 100 minutes of additional filmed interviews provided, arranged thematically.  What this documentary offers that uniquely fills in the gap in any such home film appreciation course are some direct comparisons of scenes from Kurosawa films and their American versions (e.g., ""Yojimbo"" and ""A Fistful of Dollars"").  Similarly, there are some juxtapositions of key scenes from Kurosawa films with images from his life as well as the paintings he did while preparing for film projects.The documentary combines footage from most of Kurosawa's films and interviews with key colleagues such as screenwriter Shinobu Hashimoto and actor Tatsuya Nakadai, as well as interviews with Kurosawa himself and excerpts from his autobiography (read by Paul Scofield).  At two hours in length the documentary has to neglect some popular (""The Hidden Fortress"") and critically acclaimed (""Stray Dog"") films.  However, I would not be surprised if for every Kurosawa film you note is missing you will discover a hitherto unknown Kurosawa film that you can add to your list of what to see next (somehow I have missed out on ""Red Beard"" to this point in my life).As long as you have seen at least a couple of Kurosawa's films you should be able to find this documentary informative and insightful.  Even those who consider themselves knowledgeable about his career and his films should this documentary and its bonus interviews to be of more than passing interest.",1049500800,"04 5, 2003",4.0,1

"This version of the trilogy is based on the 1997 version. I give it only three stars because the originals from 1977, 1980, and 1983 are not being made available on DVD.George Lucas should be able to change his films however he wants to, but why keep the originals away from those who really want them? Steven Spielberg released both the 1982 version and the 2002 version of E.T. on DVD. James Cameron did the same by releasing both the originals and Special Editions of The Abyss, Aliens, and Terminator 2. Why can't George?

"When I saw Stuart Gordon, the man responsible for films like Re-Animator (1985), From Beyond (1986), among other films, was coming out with a new movie called King of the Ants (2003), I was excited, as I think within the realm of horror movies, he's always managed to certainly bring a level of creativity and present disturbing imagery that seemed to be missing from many of the films in the genre.  I had no idea what to expect from King of the Ants, but I did have fun with the film.  Was it his best?  Not in my opinion, but even a mediocre Stuart Gordon film is better than a lot of the horror junk we saddled with by the major studios.The film stars an actor named Chris McKenna as Sean Crawley, a drifter type currently employed in painting peoples houses.  During one of his jobs, he meets Duke, played by George Wendt (Norm!), and said meeting changes his life as Duke introduces him to his boss, a somewhat shady character named Ray Matthews, played by one of the lesser known Baldwin brothers, Daniel, I think...anyway, Matthews owns a construction company, and is trying to land a particularly lucrative city contract, except an accountant in city hall named Gatley, played by Ron Livingston (the actor who played the main character in the 1999 film Office Space), seems to have evidence that may jeopardize Matthew's chances, so he enlists Sean to follow this accountant around, and collect information.  As Sean follows Gatley around, documenting his movements, he gets taken by Gatley's wife, Susan, played by Kari Wurher (if you watched MTV in the late 80's, you'll know who this is).  Sean reports back to Matthews, and things seem to be going well, but then after a late night meeting with a drunken Matthews, Sean is offered a chance to make a lot of money, at least more than he's ever seen.  Only one catch, Sean must kill Gatley.  After the dirty deed is done, Matthews reneges on the deal, claiming he Sean shouldn't have taken him seriously as he was drunk, and has only brought more heat down on him, and begins to put pressure on Sean to leave town, as Sean is the only link between Matthews and the recently murdered Gatley.  Well, Sean, won't leave without his money, and begins to squeeze Matthews, which is the wrong move, as Matthews and his henchmen decide to take Sean to a secluded location and beat him upside his head over the course of many days, so that he won't even know his own name, much less anything about else.  Sean gets the beating, for sure...but manages to escape...and eventually bring all his pain and torture back to his tormentors, one way or the other.So what did I think of the movie?  Well, it was certainly more serious than the films I mentioned at the beginning.  Also, while it didn't contain the level of visceral gore of some of Gordon's other films, it did have enough to cause the casual viewer a great deal of wincing.  The brutality of the beatings Sean endures, a daily whack with a golf club to the head (a 3-wood, I believe), and the ensuing physical deformation made me a bit queasy.  And then there was the nightmarish hallucinations Sean suffered during his torture, which was pure Gordon on the level of a Re-Animator...I won't spoil it, but it will stick with you long after the movie's finished (think of the transformed Chet character from the movie Weird Science, but much worse).  I liked the overall concept, but I thought some of the plot elements unnecessary and even awkward.  The whole bit about Susan, who works at a mission that Sean ends up at and spends a couple months recovering, and her eventually taking him into her home, just completely farcical.  Sure, people don't always have the best judgment, but to take an indigent drifter home with you to stay with you and your young daughter shortly after the brutal death of your husband seems like the very worst of ideas.  It was obvious that it was set up to help further along the plot, but it was just so unbelievable.  I think Wurher's character was meant to sort of see Sean as some kind of lost puppy dog type, harmless and trustworthy, but it was just very difficult to swallow.  The story did have some other fairly glaring plot holes, but it moved along pretty well, but was pretty predictable.  Some of the performances seemed odd and disjointed, but the more brutal scenes overshadowed a lot of the weak elements.  Look for the character of Beckett, played by Vernon Wells.  It took me awhile to recognize him, but I finally realized he was the same person who played the biker Wez in The Road Warrior (1981).  This isn't a wholly slick production, having a somewhat gritty feel and texture, but I thought that played nicely against the main character.  Also, time has not been a friend to George Wendt.  And if you want to see Kari Wurher all nekkid, then this is your film.  She bares a lot, almost to the point of being gratuitous, but hey, I can't really complain.  Overall, after watching the film, I couldn't help feel like a lot of opportunities were missed, as the movie seemed to get bogged down a bit in the middle, but the ending does make up for a lot.  As with most Gordon movies, if you have a weak stomach or delicate sensibilities, you may want to pass this one up.Presented here is a good looking wide screen print along with a few special features, including a 15-minute featurette, commentary by Stuart Gordon and Chris McKenna, and an original theatrical trailer.  I guess if I learned anything from this movie it's that that George Wendt sure sweats a lot...Cookieman108",1093564800,"08 27, 2004",3.0,0

"""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" is a truly unique, and hilarious viewing experience.  The entire film fuels the comedic needs of the audience by supplying enough variety in the punchlines and enough tension and build up to lead to truly hysterical moments rarely seen in films.  Prior to this film, Steve Martin already had a very established and recognizable name within the comedy genre of films with movies such as ""Little Shop of Horrors"" and ""The Man With Two Brains"" already under his belt.  The late, great, John Candy, a legend for the comedy world, also was entering this film riding the success of several past films, including ""Spaceballs"", ""Little Shop of Horrors"" and ""The Blues Brothers"".  The two actors truly shine in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" and their chemistry in the film is truly outstanding.The movie begins by showing Neal Page (Steve Martin) in a New York office, awaiting the final decision from his boss regarding a cover shot for an advertisement at the advertising company in which he works at.  With every passing second, Neal is becoming more and more frustrated, since he is already running late for his flight back to Chicago to meet his family for Thanksgiving weekend.  When he's finally free from his job, he begins his mad rush to the airport, having to fight the crowds of the crowded New York streets, and fight fellow civilians for the few free cabs that are roaming the streets.  Upon getting to a cab, just in time, he is forced to buy the cab from the man currently occupying it.  During their negotiations with one another, another man (John Candy) takes it upon himself to steal the cab and leave.Out of money that he used to pay for the cab that he didn't even get, Neal is more frustrated than before.  He arrives at the airport to find out that the man who stole his cab, Del Griffith (John Candy) is going to be on the same flight as him.  Neal's luck gets worse, since he ends up sitting next to Del on the flight, leaving him to put up with Del's constant talking throughout the trip.  Their flight touches down in Wichita, and cannot fly to Chicago until the snow blizzard there clears up, leaving Neal stranded at the airport.  He agrees to stay with Del at a local hotel, a decision he later regrets.The rest of the film focuses around the bad luck that the two men face trying to get back to Chicago.  From a train breaking down on the tracks, to not being able to find a rental car, driving the wrong way on the interstate, and blowing up a car, Neal and Del go through the worst case scenarios in some of the worst circumstances a traveler could possibly face.  Despite their constant fighting, and blaming of one another for the misfortunes they are experiencing, Neal and Del eventually bond and realize that in order to get to Chicago, the two men must put their differences aside and work with one another no matter what.The film features many hilarious scenes, including the hotel scene where Steve Martin and John Candy awake from an awkward spooning session.  Steve Martin's reaction to the rent-a-car employee is sure to provide some laughs, and the entire highway scene is one of the stand out scenes of the entire film.  The deleted scene that focuses around the flight on the airplane is worth checking out, and adds its own spark of hilarity to the film.""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" is a film that will please fans of classic comedy movies, and fans of the comedy genre in general.  Anyone who enjoys either Steve Martin or John Candy is doing themselves a huge injustice by not viewing this film.  The interaction between the two actors is what truly makes this film enjoyable, and it still stands to this day as one of the greatest films that either man was ever in.",1283558400,"09 4, 2010",5.0,1

"Back in 1943 Nikola Tesla passed away in obscurity, as designed by J. Pierpoint Morgan. Upon his death, Morgan directed his gummit employee pocket puppet, J. Edgar Hoover, to take some of his brainwashed gummit criminal cohorts and raid Tesla's  Manhattan apartment and without legal writs or cause, burglarize Tesla's intellectual proprietaries... consequently that's where the ""Manhattan Project"" came from to destroy the two cities in Japan and grab the title of ""Super Power"" among the nations of this world commencing the nefarious ""Atomic Age"".... The technology used in this movie was more of Tesla's work in action during the real life Philadelphia Experiment, however this movie was too much ""WhollyWeird"" and actually does nothing to advance the real story about Tesla's work. The technologies of Tesla and Einsteins theory of relativity and quantum physics all come together here but the failure of these two great genius's theories to understand and adiquitly explain our galaxies black holes, means they are at best, an approximation to the laws governing the universe around us, but not the final answer to what we as human beings are seeking for free energy..And I believe thats what they wanted to communicate with each and everyone of us through the written works they, Tesla and Einstein, wished to give to mankind to understand what is really going on around us in the world in which we live...  the Laws of physics that encompass all things about free energy, and what we do not yet understand and therefore cannot ourselves governLife is and will ever remain an equation incapable of solution, but it contains certain known factors. (Nikola Tesla)""Today's scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality.""

The tension of the cast as they change a new key member one week or so before opening is documented, as is the strife ,occasional between Sellars and Adams.

If you replaced Wahlberg & Patton for some better actors or directed them in their scenes it would certainly have been much better. Theres a totally unbelievable plot but it really doesnt matter since its more about the money and the buddy cop scenario. Its another decent action movie based on a comic book and similar to a much older movie titled Charley Varrick. It started off very slowly but picked up some action after about 20-minutes.

This is a painful  thing to watch, something  that you feel are required to witness, but can't watch although you feel you should. This project needed a talented editor, if so it could have been so much better. Rent it, I showed my enthusiasm by purchasing, and now, it collects dust on my library. Having said that, taste is a choice, and the momentous historical events should be examined, even if only in film, to understand the fiery delight of humans in destroying that which represents inequity.",1356480000,"12 26, 2012",3.0,0

"Ostensibly a documentary about street art, ""Exit ..."" morphs into the story of a somewhat deranged poseur named Thierry who fancies himself a street artist after hanging out with a bunch of them.  He re-invents himself as a ""M r.

The 47 Ronin is a beautiful depiction of japans beauty. The scenery and settings are so precise like the Japanese are always depicted. I have a lot of trouble with Keanu Reeves acting. I have to say this was not his best effort. He just didn't seem the right actor for the part. The Japanese actors were wonderful and made the movie very watchable.

"I'd actually seen this movie once before.  It stars Christian Bale (this movie was actually the deciding factor for casting him in the Batman movies).It is set in the future after WWIII.  Only unlike most movies where the world looks like a big junk yard, 2 distinct societies have arisen.  One lives in large, well maintained cities and the other is outside the cities just scraping by (however, some people may not be happy with this but they are just people...no zombies or disfigured mutants),Within the cities it is against the law to openly express emotions and children are even schooled (a.k.a., brainwashed) to believe that it was mans' emotions that let to world war 3.  So emotions and things that lead to their expression like art, music, etc. are outlawed.  If you are found with it they do take it to a little extreme...you are put in a furnace and burned alive.There is a special police force that has been created.  The people who live in the emotionless cities (at least they are supposed to be) can't even have things like a frame around a picture.  Which makes sense in a way since you aren't supposed to have pictures (again, of an artistic nature...like paintings).The special police are highly trained in ""flushing"" suspected people out as there are many pockets of people within the city walls who have hidden stashes of art, music, books - all from the pre-war days in various places.  These special police are referred to as ""clerics"" but are basically adults who, from childhood are taught to be emotionless, trained with highly developed fighting skills (and the fight scenes are some of the best choreographed I've ever seen in a movie) and are given a drug that must be taken every day to help suppress their emotions.  Anyone want to guess what the drug is called...okay, time's up...the drug is called Equilibrium.BTW, nothing that I've written to this point is a spoiler and I'll try not to give any. So, now I'll get a lot more general so as not to give anything away because if you like post-apocalyptic movies, movies with good fight scenes and surprise, movies that have a plot, you'll like this movie.  It is well paced and I think one of Christian Bale's better works.The people outside the cities are considered radicals because they are also ones who stash art, etc.  So the Clerics (along with regularly trained soldiers) do make trips outside the cities as well. Since sense-inducing things like poetry and music are illegal they try to find it anywhere and when they do the soldiers torch works of art and the like.Of course there has to be some personal conflict somewhere or there wouldn't be a movie.  Enter Christian Bale as more than just the Cleric orders number 1 Cleric (a.k.a., highly skilled killer) since the people who love those sentimental things are supposed to be eradicated so they don't spread those heretic ways around.***SPOILER ALERT***Christian Bale's partner, another Cleric, it seems has stopped taking his Equilibrium (that drug that suppresses emotion.  But to set up a conflict for Mr. Bale, his Cleric partner is discovered (anyone remember what the term ""red shirt"" from the original Star Trek TV series and what that implied would happen if you were chosen for a landing party...in short, once you materialized on a planet if your uniform had a red shirt you probably wouldn't make it to the next commercial...argh).  So once Christian Bale's partner is found to have developed emotion, well you can probably guess what happens to him and Christian Bale is the one who has to do it.I will leave it at this point because from there on Christian goes through many changes which causes a lot of action, shooting, really well choreographed fight seems and finding out who and what makes for a good person or bad, while a lack of emotion creates a society without everyone killing each other, no bank robberies or robberies of any kind...it begs the question is giving up emotion (what makes us human) worth giving up?Well, this movie tries to show you using and action packed drama.

"I have to admit that I bought this movie simply because it was in 3D and it was something that I had not already seen.  The CGI world was indeed impressive to see in 3D on screen.  The story was good but not great.  Had I paid $25-$30 as some new 3D movies cost, I would have found this story to be disappointing.

"Avatar (2009).........CGI at its finest.  You'll see the latest computer generated image technology.  This movie is visually stunning, in some cases breathtaking, but the story suffers while the special effects are on display.  George Lucas once said, ""A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing"".  Years after he said that, he went on to make the Star Wars prequels, which were heavy on special effects and CGI while the stories suffered.  I like the prequels, but they don't compare to the original trilogy.  It seems that James Cameron has fallen into this mode as well, at least in this film.  Great movie visually, mediocre story.This movie will make you feel like you're watching a video game.  It reminds me of the Star Wars prequels, especially Episodes I and II, and also King Kong (2005).Do I recommend this movie?  I guess so.

"Uneven and overlong film has a miscast Lucille Ball starring as a taxi dancer whose best friend becomes the victim of a serial killer who sends poems to the police the night before he dispatches each of his young and beautiful female victims, although the police have yet to discover a single body.  Lucille Ball's character is recruited by Scotland Yard to try and trap the killer.  Along the way she is pursued by the charming and wealthy Robert Fleming (George Sanders), a nightclub owner who eventually becomes both her fiance and the prime suspect.Lured would have worked as an hour long B-movie but at 102 minutes feels extremely bloated.  It also doesn't seem to have any idea tonally what kind of film it wants to be.  Lured isn't really a thriller until the last 15 minutes or so--there's very little attempt to generate any real tension until then.  Lured isn't a romantic comedy, although the banter between Lucille Ball and George Sanders occasionally suggests that it is.  Lured isn't a breezy crime film--for much of its length the movie seems completely disinterested in its own serial killer plot, abandoning it for a different criminal conspiracy that Ball's character stumbles upon, which is also ultimately discarded shortly after it is introduced.It's possible I'm prejudiced against Lucille Ball because of her subsequent fame as a sitcom actress but I simply can't buy her as a serious or even halfway serious actress.  I also honestly don't think she was much of a looker, despite characters in the film frequently referring to how beautiful she is.  She isn't bad looking to be sure, but pretty much any bargain basement starlet working at Monogram studios was more beautiful than she was.  George Sanders, perhaps most famous for playing both The Saint and The Falcon in two different B-movie series is suitably smooth and charming, but his scenes generally drag Lured away from any mooring as a thriller or mystery.  Lucille Ball's character never suspects him until about a minute before he is arrested, and the identity of the real killer is telegraphed so obviously that Sanders' scenes in police custody seem completely pointless.Director Douglas Sirk who would become famous for his 1950's melodramas clearly hadn't found his niche yet.  He seems to be trying a little bit of everything in Lured--crime drama, mystery, romantic comedy, melodrama--but none of the elements really mesh all that well, making this one a bit of a drag to sit through.Also, for anyone thinking about watching Lured because of Boris Karloff--despite receiving pretty prominent billing (not to mention being pictured on the video cover) he is in the film for less than 10 minutes as a red herring murder suspect.  I'm not sure what the point of hiring him was if they weren't going to give him anything to do.",1462147200,"05 2, 2016",2.0,-1

The characters don't ask for the Lord's help during their difficult times -- it's all about their efforts to be ""good people.""

"So I'm half way through this movie. At this point I am totally disappointed. Here's why: Bad execution! Lip synching in studio is off and poorly mixed to the point there is so much separation in the actors' audio from the video it feels like there should be a split screen showing the video footage and the actors in the studio doing their audio overdubs. It feels more like a ""Behind The Scene"" ""Making of Ant Man"" kind of effect. Regarding the lead actor(s), the lead actor doesn't have a 'Hero's' command/presence, or voice. Quite the contrary, the lead actor, whom I loved in 40 Year Old Virgin, and other movies (he's really good when cast correctly), is rather effeminate and weak, both vocally and physically. Why cast an otherwise wimp as a superhero, unless this is, in fact, a clear part of the plot? The lead actor has essentially no detectable muscle mass to the point of looking like he's never even exercised a day in his life. Really pathetic look for a so-called superhero! This is what America has devolved into...Weakness! And America now loves their males to be weak, and the weaker the better. Hollywood, or, the great facilitator of the emasculation of men in America, and augmenter of the false hope of 'girl power,' is perpetrating a massive fraud on consumers and stealing all the entertainment value from everything. It's a philosophy of 'The Weaker The Man The Better!' American women, whom are the primary consumers of entertainment products, and who would rather see all men under their weak little thumbs, today don't want to feel at all threatened by a big strong man on the big screen, so Hollywood now casts these little weakling men, more often than not, as superheroes whom, in reality, could not even bench press their own body weight. This oppressive, emasculation of men theme ruins the experience altogether, especially when the female enters the movie as a 'bad ass' who's going to teach the little sissy male actor how to fight. Yeah right! America will promote any little girl as a super bad-ass who could kick a real-mans ass if it will ""Sell Tickets!"" And it does, but only to females who love to vicariously experience being tougher than a man. It's a nice escape into an unreality for brute-minded American women, who suffer from a profound 'Penis Envy.' Ok, so now you know that America is both 'Female' and 'Weak.' Also, the music is trite, and very uninspiring, to the point of being obnoxious. The cumulative effect here is the feeling that this is Hollywood throwing, yet again, another feminized comic against the wall to see if it will stick, with not a single executive giving a crap if it actually makes any money...the old 'you can make more money off of a 'loser' than a hit mindset.' Maybe this movie was just a 'Tax Write Off' for the movie studio, and investors. Who knows; however, everything points that way. In short, I this pathetic flick is yet another manifestation of the dominant female influence in America...which has killed all hope of ever getting some real 'male entertainment' out of Hollywood, and as well destroyed all hope of this country ever becoming great again. Once I watch the next half of this movie if I should change my mind at all about this movie being part and parcel to the ongoing and growing female-driven ""Male-Weakness Paradigm"" in America I'll revise my review, otherwise I can't express how utterly disappointing this movie is thus far. I'm totally hate-watching now!",1452556800,"01 12, 2016",1.0,-1

"When I rented this DVD, I didn't have any expectations for the show except it was going to be gothic. It definitely has that feel since most of the time, the animation is gray and very dull. It is definitely one of the anime's big pitfalls, the animation. The show is not flashy in any aspect of all. The first episode is very bad at not having enough animation. For example, people are speaking and gasping in the crowd but I didn't see any one actually doing it, just these silohettes of people gathered together. The fighting isn't any better- no cool moves are shown and the monsters are as stiff as today's robots.Another problem with the show is the voice dubbing. It is unrealistic and boring. When the terrorist attack was happening, the people sounded more annoyed that frantic about the event. Also, all of the voices sounded the same- monotone and soft. The show needs a lot better voice actors. Maybe the Japanese dubbing is better, but I didn't have time to rewatch it.The only thing that keeps the anime afloat is the story. I enjoy how it keeps you in the dark about who is good and who is bad. There is also plenty other of mystery dealing with the myth of Gilgamesh too. Another plus with the story is it has good flow and balance with action even if though it isn't spectacular.If you are a person who can stand mediocre presentation for a show with a good plot, then you should give Gilgamesh a try. I prefer something a little more exciting, but I got used to the lack of life after the first couple of episodes. The show sort of grew on me.",1127433600,"09 23, 2005",3.0,0

"For those who still remember the terrific acting of Tom Berenger in Oliver Stone's 'Platoon,' it is painful to watch him in 'Sniper 3' (which is also set in Vietnam).  Not that the film is a complete failure.  Actually, Tom Berenger's performace as the veteran sniper Thomas Beckett is fairly good, if not his best.  But the film's lazy direction (from the director of 'From the Dusk till Dawn: 3' ... no wonder) is too conspicous, killing the potential that some of the actions and characters might have.Not much can be called original about the script of 'Sniper 3.'  Thomas Beckett is sent to Vietnam, where he fought his war with his buddy during the war 30 years ago.  But Beckett is informed that the friend who is supposed to be dead is now ruling the underground community as druglord (the idea inspired by 'Apocalypse Now').  And Beckett's assignment is to kill him.Byron Mann appears as Sgt. Beckett's partner from Vietnam, and Thailand provides the convincing locations for the backdrop.  Both actors did good acting, and the film tries to show the deeper characterization about Beckett, who talks about his old days, and even attends a wedding party (not drunk for that matter).  The results of the efforts are not bad.But the actions are so-so at best, with shoddy editing that often makes me wonder what is going on.  For example, after Beckett's first 'hit,' a shoot-out scene at the rooftop begins, but as the film fails to show who is shooting (at) who, the sequence only shows alternately the confusing images of men shooting guns and men who got shot.  And I still do not fully understand what happened in the last chapter, the terribly hurried and awfully incoherent wrap-up that comes with bamboo impalement.  Excuse me, but I thought this is about a sniper's story...right?Though the film is watchable thanks to the actors and locale, 'Sniper 3' reminds us of the fact that we really need somebody who can save Tom Berenger from this Grade B straight-to-video hell.",1125619200,"09 2, 2005",2.0,-1

"I HAD BIG HOPES when I heard the creative crew behind Disneys Pirates of the Caribbean franchise planned to reboot this Western classic with executive producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Gore Verbinski, and writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, to star Johnny Depp.I love Westerns. From Shane to Tombstone, Im there. And so I was for The Lone Ranger, but what a mess. Its not so much a bad Western as plain old bad story-telling.Any genre movie can be ruined by an excess of subplots and useless characters  like the madam played by Helena Bonham Carter, who makes a big show of her trick leg made of scrimshawed whale bone. It comes in handy in an end stunt, but other than that, shes got nowhere to go and nothing to do. General Custer appears midway, again demonstrating what an insufferable ass he was. (The film is loaded with clichs.) Depps Tonto, shown as an old man in a carnival show, narrates the story in a way to delay or break action. His make-up makes sense but stays in place throughout all calamities; we all know the stuff just doesn't work that way. When the real Native Americans show up, it makes Depps Tonto less than genuine, despite his heritage. Worst of all, Armie Hammers Lone Ranger spends so much time being a comic doofus, he never makes a credible transition to hero. Theres no chemistry between Depp and Hammer. Mean jokes, yes; chemistry, no.A personal gripe is the ugly thugs who like to wear bits of ladys clothing. It wasn't that funny in the Caribbean and falls flat here.Still, the good stuff is very good. Tonto has a heartbreaking and believable backstory. Bruckheimer and Verbinski give us some fun through big-time stunts, many of which have that comic edge we saw in Pirates. The villain is a nightmare: Butch Cavandish, a scar-faced bandit cannibal played by William Fichtner. Tonto tells John Reid (Hammer), the Lone Ranger-in-training, that Cavandish is a wendigo, a creature from Native American lore described as a man who becomes a demon from eating human flesh. Theres a missing scene between Tonto and John Reid after we learn more about the Rangers sidekick.Thats the kind of juice that could have given this reboot a genuine kick.Its easy to like Hammer, the actor. He is so enthusiastic, taking us through the Armies Western Roadtrip extra, giving a tour of shooting locations in New Mexico. Becoming a Cowboy shows how the actors learned to ride a horse, use a lariat and fire weapons in Cowboy Boot Camp. Riding the Rails of The Lone Ranger demos how to shoot action scenes atop moving trains (dont try this at home). One deleted scene and bloopers round out the bonus features. DVD people should note that the bloopers are the only extra on the disc. There is no commentary.Word is that Disney did not renew the project development contract with Bruckheimer because of The Lone Rangers poor showing in theaters. It is difficult to understand how the film was released in the shape its in. This is a huge company and Bruckheimers team is made up of experienced professionals. Surely a good editor could have streamlined the story and given Hammer some points on how to be a hero.Meanwhile, we have a beautiful, high-def picture, showing gorgeous location shots and outstanding sets, with a truly magnificent DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 soundtrack.

"I love End-of-The-World disaster movies, especially the ones where a new Ice Age dawns on the Earth (Psychoanalysts have at it!). So naturally, this movie was a ""Must-See"" for me.This movie was part of the Sci-Fi channel's original movie line-up and was financed by a German film company (hence most of the story revolves around a post-disaster Berlin). Not a negative, but definitely a cautionary sign, as Sci-Fi Pictures offerings seem to generally be more attempts to fill 2 hours of airtime than to offer high-quality original fare.Now technically, the movie has its short-comings (e.g. many of the special effects are so obviously animation that it jars you out of the moment - the visuals of a frozen Europe and a cold-climated North Africa are merely adequate) but this is not a fatal weakness.Acting is generally less than adequate. Dean Cain is almost decent in his leading role, but Nigel Bennett is a sad disappointment and Joanna Clark is totally out of her element (nice eye-candy, tho!)But to be fair to the actors, they had a very little with which to work. Some of the lines the actors must deliver are so over-the-top and cornball, that unintentional comedy ensues. The plot was paper-thin and soon developed more holes than a New York street after a snowstorm. The set-up is ok although logic is not it's strong suit (i.e. the justification for Dean Cain's characters involvement) but forgivable. However, the final 1/2 hour or so of the movie was so incredibly stupid, the motivation of the various antagonist so vague and well, cartoonish, that any postives of the first half of the movie are duly squandered.A movie to watch if you're stuck indoors during a blizzard, but not a keeper...",1160438400,"10 10, 2006",2.0,-1

"What else needs to be said.  It was truly boring.  I was less bored with The Motion Picture.  I was even less bored with The Final Frontier.  I love Star Trek.  I want Star Trek to be worth watching, but there hasn't been really good Trek since TNG 4th season.  That is where it started to go down.  In this movie, we are treated to cheesy character, shallow plot, really bad effects, slow music, and ""bad"" humor.  If the humor was really funny, like Voyage Home, it might have been better.  Unfortunately, the characters created in the TNG series died at the end of that series.  They have never been the same in the movies.  They didn't develop into the people they are now. They just became these people.  I don't like them.  I hope Nemesis will improve, at the very least, the story telling.

"I viewed this film when it was aired on TV and always like it. Powers Boothe (Tombstone 1993) is amazing and pulls off Jim Jones creepy, cult of personality to a T, but the video quality is really bad. There are spots, jumps and grainy texture to this DVD. Why is the quality of the promo intro credit for ""Alpha Home Entertainment"" so clear and sharp, but the actual film itself dull and grainy? Why are there a ga-zillion video previews of oldie classic B films in the special features that pre-date the main film, yet their video quality remains sound and sharp? As for the story, acting, and movie itself, I am pleased, but I am fairly disappointed in the quality and technical transfer of the DVD altogether. The movie would have been more pleasing to elaborate on the discovery and aftermath of the nearly 1000 bodies found in the jungle along with any survivors that escaped the mass suicide, but the movie ends with a gunshot and Jones in a dead stare. The film is cast with an impressive group of actors including Brad Dourif (One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest 1975), Randy Quaid (The Long Riders 1980), Irene Cara (Fame 1980), Colleen Dewhurst (The Cowboys 1972), James Earl Jones (Dr. Strangelove 1964), Ned Beatty (Deliverance 1972), LeVar Burton (Roots 1977), Diana Scarwid (Silkwood 1983), and Ed Lauter (The Longest Yard 1974).",1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2.0,-1

"Some movies are deliberately bad. Some are so deliberately bad that they are funny. This movie is most emphatically not one of them. This movie is execrable, but not deliberately so, and that is the most depressing thing of all. Someone actually thought it was good enough to warrant expending a lot of effort and money. Why else would they go to the trouble of hiring such actors as O'Toole and McDowell? I used to have some respect for Malcolm McDowell before I saw him in this crock of toxic waste. That's safely gone now, of course, but still I wonder why he accepted this role. Was he hard up for cash, or does he simply have no dignity? Or are both true? Either way, it was money ill spent. The acting is a mess, the plot is incomprehensible, the composer is a ... , whoever adapted the screenplay is an incompetent, and there are actually two directors, but all that does is give me one extra person to loathe. The fact that this movie is available on DVD is a testament to something so bad, the word to describe it has yet to be invented.Why was this movie made? There are actually people who bother coming up with intellectual rationalizations for it - id est, ""Yeah, but this is the way things REALLY WERE!"" Nonsense. Softcore pornographer Tinto Brass and hardcore pornographer Bob Guccione did not come together one day and decide to direct a realistic historical epic. No, the right answer is the most obvious one and the most difficult one to face - they actually thought this horrible, horrible movie would titillate someone. Let me repeat that to let the horror sink in - they actually thought people would be titillated by a movie which contains a scene in which a man's genitals are severed and thrown to a pair of hounds (and if you think I'm making this up, I only wish I was as naive as yourself). They actually thought people would find eroticism in a movie in which there is not only none of it, but also no pleasure, no joy, in fact not a single human emotion whatsoever aside from a sort of smug self-satisfaction at one's own disgusting vileness. Not only did they fail as directors, artists and creators, but they failed as human beings. Their movie will be forever appreciated by those who are too creatively, mentally and emotionally bankrupt to find any amusement or pleasure in anything higher than smug, bloated maliciousness, but that still does not justify its having been made.Tragically, their assumption wasn't too far off the mark. For me, the absolute worst came from having to watch this movie with other people. I'm not making any of this up: people around me actually _cheered loudly_ during the rectal fisting scene. Even wilder was their merriment during the scene in which two whores urinate on the corpse of a man who was just tortured to death (which you will also please believe that I am not making up). ""Cretinous"" is too weak a word to describe such reactions. Having to watch someone I love be genuinely entertained by this catalogue of disease was one of the most saddening and enraging events that I have ever had the misfortune of experiencing.I can forgive audiences who paid to see this in 1980. Back then, no one yet knew what an atrocity this movie is. But twenty-odd years have passed since then. Now no one has any shred of an excuse to see this movie. As you read this, it is entirely within your power to exercise a very small amount of effort and purchase _any_ other movie. If you pass up the chance to do this, and use your money to buy Caligula instead, I hope I never meet you.",1028505600,"08 5, 2002",1.0,-1

"Time is not kind to this work. It is probably best enjoyed during your college years, when sophomoric profundity is most potent. Later, as an adult, you will watch this movie with smiles and with laughter. Affectionate amusement, to be sure, but the movie will disappoint. It starts with a couple of actors playing a fourteenth-century knight and his squire, asleep upon rocks on a beach. That's right: they are sleeping on rocks. The men appear uncomfortable, not surprisingly, and they do not seem to be asleep. In fact, they appear to be precisely what they are: a couple of actors, dressed in cheap costumes, pretending to be asleep. Unfortunately, this is only the first of many amateurish scenes. The acting throughout ""The Seventh Seal"" is at about the standard of a high-school play. There's even a juggler who cannot juggle. The editing is clunky. Bergman cannot direct action. The movie is alternately tedious and unintentionally funny. It is frequently campy and it is consistently cheesy. The script lacks plausibility and, oh, the striving for deep thoughts. Enjoy this film but, please, be honest: you are watching it through loyalty towards something you thought was wonderful when you were young. Yes, profundity can sometimes be found in an old black-and-white subtitled European movie. It will not be found in this one. Even Bergman, after a couple of beers, might admit that this early work should be ranked amongst his juvenilia.",1073347200,"01 6, 2004",2.0,-1

"The actors did a nice job.  I can't imagine anyone else playing zealot quite like Voight.  Ladies and gentlemen, that's how you play crazy with conviction and, dare I say, heart.  The obscure doctrine, blood oaths, and early fanaticism was well portrayed, as was the corrupting obtuseness of polygamy and the obvious insanity of mixing governance & religion...yes, that was a castration in the beginning.  I also loved the use of a romance between the Mormon bishop's son and a mainstream preacher's daughter as a vehicle for a religious debate, though I don't think they made use of this enough.I did not like the generic uplifting horse/western-movie music during the first half.  Also, the directing or use of certain takes had some lines too rushed or otherwise incomprehensible to laymen.  Obscure references require less-than-obscure delivery, and reaction shots interspersed to stretch it.  The Bishop and son fighting about the dead mother is one instance.  Not the actors' fault.  While the writing was well done for the most part, sans the lack of exploiting the aforementioned debates more, there's an odd turn towards the end into cheap shots like pointing out how little education Brigham Young had or calling him the ""Mormon God"".I think this last point might derive from a hijacking of the film by a sort of Christian Coalition or evangelical attempt to pit protestant Christians against Mormons, stemming possibly from the belief some have that Mormons are not ""Christian"" and that they worship Joseph Smith.  Certainly to each his own.  There is even a case to be made in a manner of speaking.  Yet while within the film the ""unfailing voice of God"" attribute early leaders had is out in the open for criticism by all, these associated attacks outside of the culpability in the massacre itself lacked either objectivity or even proper subjective development when used by those outside the anti-Mormon mob shown in the film.While it's clear in the specific instance of the Mountain Meadows event that the perpetrators can be juxtaposed to the victims to show a revealing contrast in beliefs, this eventual slant in the general terms amounts to the pot calling the kettle black.  Multiple slips like that I'm afraid tipped their hand.  Ending with a country music song didn't help matters, giving September Dawn a faintly made-for-TV, patriotic right-wing cred like something that might play on God TV.  In spite of all this, the climax of the film does work.  The death scene is powerful.  We are left with a sense of having been shown a very obvious trend of culture, preceding timeline, and complex psychologies that led to yet another example of systemic mass murder.",1262476800,"01 3, 2010",3.0,0

Also, some of the movies are dark, hard to see, grainy, and just generally poor quality. I guess you get what you pay for in some respects.

"It's sad to see two brilliant actors like Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson trying vainly to kick some life into this pallid romantic comedy that isn't very funny or romantic. What it is is entirely predictable, full of cliches and thoroughly mediocre.Both these stars seem to have disappeared from movies recently. If they thought this tired vehicle would revive their flagging careers, they are dead wrong.Hoffman plays a 60-something composer of advertising jingles down on his luck, flying to London to attend his daughter's wedding. When he arrives, he finds he's been shouldered out of his role as father of the bride by his ex-wife's second husband. To make matters worse, he's informed by phone he's lost his job.Thompson is a 40-something, left on the shelf as love passes her by. The two meet up in an airport bar and strike up what the scriptwriters try to pretend is an attraction. Actually, there's no real chemistry between them; both are just reading their badly-written lines.The real star of his movie is the city of London which looks brilliant.Other than that and the fact that there's no sex, violence or foul language, there's not much to say in its favor.",1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2.0,-1

"I first saw this movie when it came out several years ago because I was a huge Jude Law fan. I  watched it again last night,and it is even better, more nuanced and complex than I remembered. It's a beautiful, classy suspense film and psychological thriller. Matt Damon is  Ripley, a true villain,  who hides his sick, cunning dark side behind a facade of obsequiousness, awkwardness, naivet and  people pleasing. Damon is so good, playing a character consumed by jealousy and repressed lust, driven to murder and soul suicide. Jude Law created a seductive, complex human being in Dickie Greenleaf, heir to a fortune, spoiled, irresistible. Law is exceptionally talented and had a great knack for playing beautiful, seductive young men and I love watching him. I admire him, too, for not pursuing super stardom based on his looks. He' s really an actor's actor and I love him for that, too!  I had forgotten that PhilipSeymour Hoffman was in this movie, and appreciate even more now his huge talent. His ability to disappear into a role and his inventiveness was magical. Gwyneth Paltrow, CateBlanchett, Jack Davenport and James Rebhorn --all give award worthy performances.Set in Italy, the photography and design, from sets to lighting to clothing, create a delicious, captivating, scary entertainment.

I was not aware that this was a 'Troma' film as some of the other reviewers have suggested, as this was made in the mid to late seventies.

"Where to start?  Maybe find the director and or writer and slap them and ask them what they were thinking!  They had a great story to tell with one of the all time best actresses and they ""over-thought"" it.  Her life was amazing enough without trying to be so complex about it.One of the biggest challenges with doing a bio-pic like this is if you cover a life from beginning to end, 180 minutes is not enough.  They should have just focused in on a couple of significant events in her life that helped explain her and did the story.  But rather you are told the story from an 80 year old woman who is suffering from mental illness.  I have heard she is suffering from Alzheimer's but in the movie they make it look like the disease from A Beautiful Mind.Not only is from her perspective, but then we get flashbacks.  Start at the end of her career, then flashback to the beginning.. Back to the end.. Then back to the 1970s'.  Then from the 70's back to the beginning, then back to the end.  Yep - flashbacks within flashbacks.Here is how disappointing this film is.  It is called The Iron Lady because the Russians gave her that name because of her tough negotiating. Yet, the film NEVER shows her negotiating with the Russians.If you watch it for the acting you will not be disappointed but you will walk away shaking your head at what the film makers could have done and instead it was wasted.",1334448000,"04 15, 2012",2.0,-1

"Maybe the most important and even discretely suggested message in the film be the harsh childhood of the three principal personages along the film. Every one of them suffered the rigors of a merciless and cruel father before the quiet presence of the mother. One of them opted by being a serial killer to vindicate his fears and somehow to redeem anybody who pretended to be happy: you will see the angels very soon. This bloody attitude reveals a classic answer, a scream in the darkness inside his phantom world. The pleasure and the sublime act of love seems to be in him just a special sparkling ignition to put in action the ancestral codes of repressed anger and restrained fury. The rest of the world will have to pay his internal frustrations: so simple like that.In the other hand we have to Mike a good for nothing guy, an extremely frightened man who seems to be a sleepwalker in the life without will, personality and responsibility. His sister developed a stronger character and somehow she has to carry that awful weight with him.In this state of things this serial killer superbly played by Tom Berenger - a very neglected actor by Hollywood- makes an interesting role of this disturbed mind murderer, who will appear in the isolated Oregon Valley appearing to change seriously the bitter situation of both brothers.The idea was terrific and my only claim was precisely not emphasize in this sense.

Like I said, the story is a bit weird, but it's extremely entertaining. The whole cast is terrific and the film is much more than what it appears to be on the outside. It's about living your life to the fullest and believing in whatever it is that makes you happy.

"As I first saw previews for FIRST DAUGHTER, I thought it looked like a really cute movie. I never saw it in theatres, but I rented it today, and I can't say I was too impressed by it.FIRST DAUGHTER is about the president's daughter (played by Katie Holmes, who I find really likeable). She feels like she's being treated like a little kid, even though she's heading off to college, and she just wants some more freedom. Of course, she gets watched over all the time, and when she gets to college it isn't any different. Along the way, she makes friends with Mia, her roommate that's always looking for a good time, and James, her RA. Just as Samantha starts to fall for James, she finds out that he has a huge secret.I enjoyed FIRST DAUGHTER, but the storyline was really predictable and somewhat forgettable. It seemed like it was trying too hard to be the next Princess Diaries, and if that's your kind of movie, I'd recommend getting FIRST DAUGHTER.Overall grade - C",1108339200,"02 14, 2005",3.0,0

"There were two things that made me want to see THE DEVILS CARNIVAL.  The first was the name Darren Lynn Bousman under the directors credit.  The second was the 55-minute running time.  Bousman has made a lot of films people don't like (SAW II, III and IV), but I dig his work and his dedication to the genre, so Im a fan.  And people really seem to love the previous Bousman/Terrance Zdunich collaboration, REPO! THE GENETIC OPERA, which, I admit, I haven't seen, but, come on, THE DEVILS CARNIVAL is 55 minutes.  I can watch this entire movie before its time to take my son to school for drill team at 6:00 and not have to finish it when I get back like usual.  Now thats the movie for me.The plot of the movie is based on three of Aesops Fables, The Scorpion and the Frog, The Dog and Its Reflection and Grief and His Due, and it features some pretty recognizable faces in some pretty unrecognizable roles.Three people, John, Ms. Merrywood, and Tamara all wake to find themselves in a very strange and demonic carnival.  John is a grieving father who wound up here after slitting his wrist in the bathroom.  He wakes up and immediately sets about finding his lost son, Daniel, whom he knows is somewhere in the carnival.  Theres Tamara who is a sucker for a bad boy, even though theyve done nothing but hurt her in life.  Wandering around, she finds a stereotypical bad boy called The Scorpion, locked in a cage, asking her to please help him.  Do you trust me? he asks.  She does.  Unfortunately.  Then theres Ms. Merrywood, a thief in life, a woman more in love with diamonds and jewels than anything else, so enamored with them she seeks them out at any cost.The three lost souls are left to their own devices in the Devils Carnival, and each, in their turn, fall victim to the sins that haunted them in life.The Scorpion betrays Tamara, Ms. Merrywood is made a slave to her greed, and Johnwell, thats the one that sort of confused me.  Im not familiar with the Grief and His Due fable, so that part of the story was lost on me.  However, the other two characters stories, I really enjoyed.THE DEVILS CARNIVAL is a musical, with about 95% of the story being told in song.  Its no ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, but, Zdunich has definitely written some winners here, A Penny for a Tale and Prick! Goes the Scorpions Tale being, for me, the most memorable.I enjoyed keeping an eye out for the actors I recognized, seeing Dayton Callie (Sons of Anarchy) under all that Ticket-Keeper makeup, or trying to find Alexa Vegas (SPY KIDS) Wick character.  Bill Moseley (THE DEVILS REJECTS) has a brief appearance as a magician while Paul Sorvino (GOODFELLAS) is God.  Sean Patrick Flannery (BOONDOCK SAINTS) plays John the grieving father and Jessica Lowndes (AUTOPSY) is Tamara.  For such a small movie with a reported budget of only $500,000, it was surprising to see so many actors I knew.THE DEVILS CARNIVAL isn't for everyone, I admit.  The plot takes a lot of unexpected and strange turns, and never really gels into a cohesive whole, but instead plays like an anthology movie (CREEPSHOW, for instance), without the chapter breaks between stories, instead featuring all of the separate stories at once, and letting the viewer figure out whats going on.  Its a smart movie, and I enjoyed it, but I think its got too much working against it to really appeal to a huge audience.  However, I also think the audience it does find is probably going to be a pretty loyal one.  I know Im ready for the sequel.Zdunich and Bousman are definitely a team that work well together and I look forward to seeing what they do next, wherever their muses take them.",1392940800,"02 21, 2014",4.0,1

"Just finished watching 'to a tee"" written and directed by Matt Riddlehoover and released by Made It Myself Pictures.""to a tee"" is Matt Riddlehoover's first movie; and it's a rather interesting one because none of the characters in this movie are particularly likable and are extremely self-centered - except for one. [In fact, the actress who played the most likeable character movie noted in the DVD extras that none of the characters are likeable in this movie.Matt plays David - a playwright who takes the adage write what you know quiet literally - his plays are in reality one-sided views - his own - of his failed past relationships.  David is insecure and wants to be liked; but he isn't above using people to further his own aims and to focus on his favorite topic - himself.Into the hollow that is David's life, comes a multitude of boyfriends - all played by actor Joss Brandon who masterfully takes on different apperances and accents.  David looses each boyfriend because he can't get past his obession with himself and his wants.So when his best friend of the moment begins a relationship with the man she hopes to marry - naturally David wants him.  But its hard for me to have any smypathy for a woman who delibrately enters into a romantic relationship with a gay man thinking that she'll convert him, and then sets up a test with her boyfriend and gay best friend to see if they'll betray her.  SPOILER ALERT!  - DUH!Riddlehoover creates an unflinching look at life in ""to a tee.""  Don't watch this movie if you're expecting characters to have life changing moments that causes them to grow and flourish.Not a great movie, not a bad one either.Recommended for those who are intrigued enough to see Riddlehoover's first movie.Three Stars!",1422835200,"02 2, 2015",3.0,0

"I think this film was unfairly branded a disaster right from the start because the star, Lindsay Lohan, is more known for being a real-life tranwreck than anything else. But the truth is, I don't mind her as an actress, and she's actually fairly competent in a role that could easily turn into parody and undermine the ""heavyness"" of what the story is all about. I also thought Julia Ormand was great as the concerned and confused mother.The plot was interesting, and kept me engaged until the very end, though in the process managed to throw a few curveballs that I felt were unsubstantiated and meant only to make the viewer more confused. It also seemed like the scenes of Lindsay dancing in the strip joint went on forever. I guess a lot of guys wouldn't complain, lol, but it seemed pretty gratuitous anyhow, even if there was no actual nudity. It's like, we get it, you're low class, now move on. Lastly, there was a general ""made for tv"" feeling about the whole thing, suggesting the budget was limited. That didn't affect the performances, but some of the graphic effects came off as corny.In the end, I'm impartial to the movie. I found it in the bargain bin at a chain store, and it was worth watching once for the price. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to recommend it, but I also felt like I needed to defend it against the people who said it was the epitomy of bad film-making.

"Ranma 1/2 Random Rhapsody is a DVD box set of the sixth season of Ranma 1/2.  This set contains a total of twenty-four episodes.  The first four discs contain five episodes, while the fifth disc contains four episodes and the special features.There are six special features on this set: ""Line Art Gallery,"" ""Textless Opening,"" ""Textless Ending,"" ""Cast List,"" ""Actor Profiles,"" and ""Maison Ikkloku Trailer.""  As expected, the textless opening and ending are just the opening and ending credits without the text.  The line art gallery contains eighteen pages of model sketches of the characters that appear in this DVD box set.  The cast list is a list of the English and Japanese voice actors for each character.  The actor profiles are selected filmographies for the English voice actors.  The ""Maison Ikkoku Trailer"" is a trailer for the Maison Ikkoku DVD box sets that were released by Viz Media.Ranma 1/2 Random Rhapsody is a rather ""low frills"" DVD set.  While the special features are better than what appeared on the first Ranma 1/2 DVD box set, I wish more of an effort had been made with the special features.While this set could be considered a little high-priced for what you get, the episodes are worth the cost.  This series is very enjoyable for an older audience (16 and up), and really should be in an anime fan's DVD collection.",1248134400,"07 21, 2009",3.0,0

This is a very scary movie. Bela Lugosi's role as Frankenstein makes the monster frightening. The last scene of the movie is the most memorable.

They kill him to death. Oh my god. That's a black comedy. If that wasn't that boring and I saw this parts sooner, maybe I'd have a better rating for it.",1294704000,"01 11, 2011",1.0,-1

If you can get by the 80's opening, you are in for a poorly acted hard to follow film. Korda is an engineer working on an automobile that runs off an energy cell. It will revolutionize how we travel. Needless to say everyone wants it for one reason or another and all the women want his sorry moody butt. There is also a gang of youths displaced by the factory which destroys cars.

I seriously want to punch the teenage kids in the face in this.  I realize they are supposed to be annoying teenagers, but they make you want to yell at the tv.  Secondly the story line of this is very dumb.  What were you thinking Bruce?  Bruce also doesn't have very many funny lines in this, which is odd for one of his movies.I can honestly say the only part that was really funny in this is when a hooker comes up and demands money from him ""for services"" in front of a girl he is trying to date.",1421107200,"01 13, 2015",1.0,-1

"I'd have to agree with someone else that said that this extended cut of ROTK is not as good as those of TTT and FOTR.  We get a few nice scenes here and there, but I feel as if in general, they don't add much.(not in any particular order...)1)  Beginning scene with Saruman- good addition, but unfortunately marred by the very fake looking fireball.2)  I liked the extra scene of Gothmog's death- he was a bit too important of a character to have dismissed his death so lightly.3) Eomer's bawling scene with Eowyn- fantastic!4) A few more shots of Gamling, but I don't think we ever find out how he dies? if he even does.5) The much hyped House of Healing is too hyped; there's not enough of an interaction between Faramir and Eowyn to justify their strong love for each other in my opinion.6) The secret hidden cameo of Peter Jackson as a pirate getting killed by Legolas' errant arrow is farkin' hilarious.  Abosolutely a hoot!7) Aragorn's killing of the Mouth of Sauron did seem a bit strange- uh, weren't they discussing under a truce flag?  Just a bit of movie trivia here, but the Mouth was played by Bruce Hopkins, the same actor who played the Trainman in the Matrix:Revolutions.  Interesting, both characters had bad teeth...8) Was the witch king really more powerful than Gandalf the WHITE?9) Enjoyed the additional combat footage; e.g. the orcs initially faily to break through the gates of Minas Tirith, and needing to bring up Grond.  Also liked the sweeping wide shots of the siege towers attacking the walls.  And, the orcs' attacking Osgiliath is clarified a bit more as well.In conclusion, it was a decent cut, but not the best.

"The simplicity and weight of the final question sums up this well-made film.  The good use of transitional shots created a good sense of place.  The progressive character development effectively built up the mood for the physical and social environment and the viewer's attachment to the various people in the story.  The pacing of normal life created empathy and made the frenzied climax more potent. The humanity of those involved is shown in a realistic response to the tragedy.I first encountered Michael B. Jordan on ""All My Children"" and I could see he had talent even then.  It's good to see a former soap actor break out and become a star, because so often really talented actors can't shake their soap opera past.  He deserves all the success that's coming to him.",1393113600,"02 23, 2014",4.0,1

Denzel's character actually is named for Woodward's character.  The Equalizer was very entertaining.  In it Denzel was a retired spy who'd obviously made a promise to his deceased wife that he would stay out of the spy game, but broke that promise when he saw someone in trouble.  He's a stand-up guy.  A guy with specialized skills.  The fight scenes were nicely choreographed.  The supporting cast was good.

"""The Rapture"" (1991) is directed by Michael Tolkin with Mimi Rogers as a LA telephone operator who spends her after work hours cruising with her boyfriend in the search of the other couples to swing the partners. She realizes that her life has no purpose and leads her nowhere and she turns to a religious sect for spiritual guidance...It's been several weeks since I saw the film and I am still not sure what it was, a riveting dark drama about searching for faith, accepting spiritual awakening, preparing yourself for the second coming of Christ and for Apocalypses now or the ridiculous piece of trash. I think it could be both and it depends on how you feel toward the Christianity, the possibility of undergoing a religious conversion, and the readiness to sacrifice the most precious that you have to prove your faith and love for God. It also depends on how you feel about the dialogs in the movie - the quote that I've chosen for the title of this review may give you an idea of what to expect.What I am sure of is that Mimi Rogers gave a fine performance, and she is a reason enough to see ""The Rapture"". Rogers is a very capable and attractive actress and should be recognized more.2.5/5",1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2.0,-1

Originally airing on ABC as a Movie of the Week, ""Duel"" deals with a man, played by Dennis Weaver, who is driving on the highway and is terrorized by a madman driving a full-ton truck. A very suspenceful film, the direction is the best of any film made for television. This was the film that made producers realize how talented Speilberg was, and he was ultimately offered big screen films like ""Jaws"". The DVD is exceptional with a wonderful interview with Steven and the making of this classic.

As far as ensemble goes, films usually use that when they're talking about movies that feature an incredibly talented cast of actors and actresses, which was definitely not the case in this movie.  I suppose they meant it more in the vein of an 'ensemble cast' which is made up of members in which the principal actors are assigned roughly equal amounts of importance and screen time.  I guess you could say it did do that which was probably why it moved so slow and I ultimately didn't care what happened to any of them.Anyone else notice the illustration on the DVD cover, had nothing to do with the movie?",1465689600,"06 12, 2016",2.0,-1

"If youve read my other DVD reviews on Amazon you will know that I really hate spoilers in reviews of mysteries and crime dramas. Its honestly unfair to spoil the discovery by the next viewer. So Ill try to present the basics here and provide no spoilers.The 140-minute film (it is not a series) was produced for the commercial UK network, ITV, in 2015 and was originally a two episode series. It was apparently re-edited (if that is the correct word) for US TV to become THREE parts, running between 45 and 47 minutes each. On the DVD you can play the whole film, which is what I did.About 10 years ago Director James Strong made a documentary about the Leicester scientist, Dr. Alec Jeffreys, who discovered DNA fingerprinting in 1984 and how his landmark discovery was used for the first time to capture a criminal. This new film uses those actual events and adds some drama to tell the story. Strong is also the Director of the wonderful BBC series Broadchurch and had previously worked with scriptwriter Michael Compton on the Silent Witness series.While I plan to seek out the documentary film (of which I wasn't aware), I found that the excellent script explains what DNA is in a very easy to understand manner. Most people think DNA was discovered in the 1950s (and probably in the US  rather than a small community of England).There is some mystery here as to who the person was, who raped and killed two 15-year-old girls (two years apart) just a few miles away from each other in the Leistershire town, but thats not the main purpose of the film; its about how the killer was discovered.Because both the homicide detective and the scientist are still alive, and actually came to the film set, there is a sense that this is as it happened. The DVD version has an excellent 28-minute behind the scenes featurette (one of the best of these Ive seen lately) which includes lots of comments by the two real life characters as well as the actors who play them. The writer and director are both here too.As I noted above, Im not a fan of spoilers. Each of the three episodes has a :synopsis on the screen if you choose to play by episode. At least two of these give a spoiler, so I highly recommend that you skip reading these. And do not watch the bonus feature until after watching the film. Spoilers abound there.There is some violence - minimally shown, and one use of graphic language. No nudity. The subtitles were easy to read, thought I found the accents easy to understand and didn't use them.I don't remember seeing this series playing on PBS, so I can easily recommend the DVD (again, because of the bonuses).  Another fine release from Acorn.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve RammAnything Phonographic",1499126400,"07 4, 2017",5.0,1

"As a mild reader of Shakespeare, I have seen filmed adaptations of only Hamlet, Macbeth, and Romeo & Juliet. Even though there are a few flaws attached to these movies, I still found them enjoyable, except for one. Baz Luhrmann's 1996 film adaptation of Romeo & Juliet is one that I can't really adore. The entire film is bloated with an overly stylish look and a modernization that looks to have gone too far. First off, I will say that hearing Shakespearean dialogue in a completely modern setting is very awkward. It really confuses the tone of the film: it's like hearing the dialogue from the Lord of the Rings trilogy in a contemporary sports drama. Old and new doesn't work well here. The lack of accents are even worse. Most of these actors sound odd when reciting the text, mainly because they don't have the perfect voices for it. I may be a bit picky, but hearing Shakespeare from modern characters sounds strange. The script could have at least had some contemporary phrases added in. The biggest problem I have with this movie, however, is the excessive style. The Capulet scene especially is overstuffed with colorful costumes and sets, and some dizzying camerawork. The melodrama in the quieter scenes are so overdone that they're actually silly. The heartbreaking ending is slightly over-the-top, but at least it's done quite well. Nonetheless, a majority of this film is a spectacle of style-over-substance, and I don't think Shakespeare would be pleased with it if ever he were alive to see it.Maybe I'm just not a fan of Luhrmann. I've seen his other film, Moulin Rouge!, and I dislike it for some of the same reasons I dislike Romeo + Juliet. I do like the music and the supporting cast, but I don't care about everything else in the movie.Grade: D",1274227200,"05 19, 2010",2.0,-1

"Not many films make me feel stupid for actually watching them, but this movie did.  Despite starring LL Cool J (who generally happens to at least make stupid films entertaining) this film falls so far flat that it almost bows under and creates a ditch.  Chris Klein is a horrendous actor and he manages to muddle up nearly everything he comes in contact with, and no matter how hot Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is (just Romijn now), she doesn't bring anything to this film outside of her body, and that just can't cut it.  The violence is cheap, the script is preposterous and the action sequences feel third rate.

"Though this film runs just over three and a half hours long, the time flew by for me as though it were nothing.  Written by the legendary Fritz Lang and his then-wife Thea von Harbou, it begins with an intertitle explaining that when a sleeping yogi in a tomb is awakened from his trance, he is commanded to absolutely obey the one who found him and reanimated him.  In this case, Prince Ayan III (Conrad Veidt), the Rajah of Eschnapur, finds Ramigani (Bernhard Goetzke) and orders him to go to Europe to find an architect to construct for him a Taj Mahal-like tomb for his faithless wife Princess Savitri.  Ramigani goes to the house of Herbert Rowland, who at first won't hear of returning with him to India, particularly without telling his fiance Irene Amundsen (Mia May, wife of director Joe May), but before long he comes around and departs with him.  Irene's father has called her over to his house to tell her that he feels someone is trying to lure Herbert away from her; she initially thinks that's nonsense, but has her suspicions pinged, so much so that she returns to his house to check things out.  Though Ramigani used his powers to take away the letter which Herbert left for her against his orders, Irene finds out anyway that Herbert left with an Indian, and makes up her mind to follow after him.  And there the adventure begins.The story packs in a lot of suspense and drama, with the viewer never knowing what's going to happen next.  There are lepers, tigers, crocodiles, chases, mind control, snakes, shootouts, intrigue, the whole nine yards.  And though the actors don't really look anything like actual Indians, one still gets the distinct feeling of India, with its culture, religion, history, and architecture, from the picture.  The sets and costumes are all lavish and really give the film a sense of time and place.  It's also kind of refreshing to see that Herbert and Irene are an older couple, not the typical movie couple in their late teens or early twenties, and while not homely, aren't candidates for the 50 most beautiful people of the year either.  (Though some people, both past and present, have lambasted Frau May as being too pudgy or chubby, I didn't notice a weight problem, but then again, I don't think a normal woman is a size six.  She looks healthy and natural, not like a stick figure.)  While the story starts out with the basic premise of Herbert being taken to India to construct a tomb for the Maharajah, and Irene chasing after him, it soon gets a whole lot more complex.  We find out that the woman for whom the tomb is to be built is very much alive, and the Maharajah wants to imprison her in it as punishment for how she cuckolded him with the handsome British officer MacAllan (Paul Richter).  MacAllan himself is still in India, and Prince Ayan is determined to get revenge on him as well as his wife.  Gradually, Irene and Herbert are drawn more and more into the intrigue and suspense all around them, to where it starts to feel like the point of no return.1921 was a great year for films, at about the height of the transitional point between the acting and filmmaking styles popular in the Teens and the more natural and complex ones that evolved in the Twenties, and this film is no exception.  It's a great epic adventure, and still packs a mighty punch over 85 years later.  The suspense and drama are also greatly helped along by a superb musical score and a very nice print.  Given how chopped-down it was in its original American release, it's a wonder it survived at all, and in such good condition.",1182211200,"06 19, 2007",5.0,1

"I really wanted to like this movie, given the cast. After reading the summary, I thought to myself, ""oh, another one of ""THESE"" movies""... meaning that the criminal just out of the joint and just need to do one last ""job"" (so he says) mixed with the 2 siblings on either side of the law family drama. Don't we have enough of those movies? Anyway, the mere fact that Clive Owen, Billy Crudup, Lili Taylor and James Caan are in this movie led me to give it a chance. They were wonderful, the movie was very lackluster, to say the least.The first half was extremely boring and, given that so little happens, I was surprised that they didn't take that to be the perfect opportunity to work on some character development, cuz there's virtually none of that. I really didn't care what happened to any of these people. Except maybe Lili Taylor's cuz she just plays sincere and caring so well.As I said, all the actors were wonderful, including Mila Kunis, Zoe Saldana and Marion Cotillard (none of whom get a whole lot to work with... the women in this film are pretty much relegated to being girlfriends or ex-wives). There was some good action and suspense for a bit 2/3rds of the way in but then a really boring car chase. I had to laugh when the maracas kicked in on the Latin tinged suspenseful score during the chase scene. I don't know... had a feeling that the original screenplay was edited like crazy and the finished product was, unfortunately, this.3-stars just for the actors being in the film and doing a kick-ass job (oh, and also for the costume, prop and set designers!!) but 2-stars for the film.",1425513600,"03 5, 2015",3.0,0

"This is the first Friday the 13th movie that doesn't pick up where the last movie left off.  From Friday the 13th Part II to Friday the 13th Part VIII, all of them picking up at some point where the previous movie left off.  This is the first Friday the 13th movie that was done under the New Line Studios instead of the usual Paramount studios, which some wonder what kind of changes were done from the Paramount to the New Line Friday the 13th.One of the things that was changed was the way that Jason looked, while in the Paramount Friday the 13th's Jason had more of a sinister look to him making him look a little more freaky looking.  In this one Jason does look good, but overall I don't think that he looks scary enough, though that don't stop this movie having any gross parts to comic parts that's been known to be in some of these movies.  Overall I think that the movie was good but it could've been a little better.  I give the movie gets a 3 but with the extras it bumps it up to a overall 3.5 stars out of 5.",1279324800,"07 17, 2010",3.0,0

"Going into this as someone who has not played the video game on which this was based (and is strictly interested in the movie):1. This movie has been done a few times too many for my taste. (The emotionally wasted avenger.) So, there are not that many happenings that could not have been predicted based on other movies.2. The best part of the movie was actually Ludacris. His effortless transition from rapper to actor was well showcased in this film. In fact, I didn't even know it was him until the credits rolled.3. The movie was also not realistic. Drugs can't get through the FDA even if they have been shown to have a slight increase in heart attacks (Bextra). Are we really supposed to believe that a drug that created horriible hallucinations in 99% of its subjects would be put on sale anywhere?4. Would a hitman really have killed a baby who couldn't even talk because his mother found out something that could jeopardize ""the corporation""? And for that matter, why not wait until all three of the family members were at home and execute everyone?5. Can we really believe that a drug company could purchase an ENTIRE police force and keep it a secret?

"Looking for a heartpounding thriller? Looking for ""Kingdom of Heaven Meets the Exorcist""? Look elsewhere or prepare to be disappointed. Season of the Witch is escapist dumb fun, and nothing more.The BAD:The acting is pretty run-of-the-mill (save Ron Perlman who's goofy antics actually mix well with the movie's overall tone); The actors never ""carry the viewer away"" to another time or place- you never forget you are watching Nick Cage and company instead of a medieval crusaders. Also, the trailer makes the story seem much better than it actually is. The story is paper thin, and the thrills aren't particularly all that thrilling. The movie is disappointing in that the trailer promises so much more than it actually delivers; I would have loved to see a serious, dark, brooding film filled to the brim with actual drama and dread.The GOOD:Crass humour and inane dialogue demonstrate that the movie never takes itself too seriously, so niether should the viewer. The plot moves at a break- neck pace, so it's never dull or boring. The mystery of whether she is or isn't a witch holds up well through most of the film, as well.

As long as I let my eyes glaze over the surface of this film it was pleasant.  I didn't expect anything of significance and so I was not disppointed.  As the American Wally says, ""Expectations lead to disappointment.""  One of the more meaningful moments was Wallis' dance to the tune whose words were something like ""I am pretty, I am pretty, I am empty.""  That just about sums up this film.

"It's just crude. This series is crudely conceived, crudely written and tragically wastes some excellent talent. The creators seem to have set out to make a gritty and visceral series about human frailties and exquisite art and all they have done is string together a necklace of unbalanced beads that neither adorn nor dazzle.Sadly, it's a dream cast of people who manage to shine even when trudging through monotonous, melodramatic slime. The actors occasionally overcome the material and good for them when they do. Bless them for it.It would be great if the people who create these kinds of shows would realize that the majority of people who turn on the TV want to like characters and enjoy the stories, not hate them. The servants on Downton Abbey were as mundane as characters come but people all over the world loved them. I could not love the people on Flesh and Bone. And it isn't about ballet dancers being terrible humans. I've known ballet dancers, both active and retired, and choreographers, and they are just people with lives and hopes and they could easily be the kind of characters we look forward to seeing every week.As for the writers, their attempts to be dramatic were just trite. I made it to episode 3 before they tossed in the bit about killing innocent baby birds (that isn't a metaphor, they did it). I suppose it was meant to be shocking and it wasn't. I knew what would happen as soon as I saw the ballet dancers innocently admiring the nest on the ledge.If you want to watch beautiful people make you hate your own species, this is the series to watch.

"There are many detractors for this very long (146 minutes) film, complaining that it is too emotional, too melodramatic, too 'Lassie Come Home', to over the top as a tearjerker, too Steven Speilberg and John Williams, et cetera. Well, it has all those elements but depending on the emotional vulnerability of the viewer the film can easily become a catharsis during this period of time when very little makes sense and the need for positive input into matters of the heart has rarely been more keen. Not having seen the stage play based on the book of the same name by acclaimed children's writer Michael Morpurgo, adapted for stage by Nick Stafford, this viewer is at a disadvantage in judging the story alone as here it is enhanced by gorgeous cinematography and amazingly realistic battle scenes. Lee Hall and Richard Curtis created the screenplay and seem to have allowed a proscenium stage story to expand into the spaces a play can only describe, and Steven Spielberg has taken it from there.The time of the story in set in Devon, England. To his wife Rose's (Emily Watson) dismay war injured and silenced farmer Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan)  buys a thoroughbred horse rather than a plough animal that might save their leased farm form landowner Lyons (David Thewlis), but when his teenaged son Albert (Jeremy Irvine) trains the horse and calls him Joey, the two becoming inseparable, Albert does indeed manage to train Joey how to plough fields. When his harvest fails due to rain, Ted has to sell Joey to an army captain (Tom Hiddleston) who takes the horse into the battlefields of World War I the British cavalry and he is shipped to France. After a disastrous offensive he is captured by the Germans and changes hands twice more before he is found, caught in the barbed wire in No Man's Land four years later and freed in a scene between a British soldier and a German soldier that is one of the most memorable scenes in the film. Joey is returned behind British lines where Albert, now a private, has been temporarily blinded by gas, but still recognizes his beloved Joey. However, as the Armistice is declared Joey is set to be auctioned off. The results of the final auction seals the fate of the extraordinary lad and horse relationship in a most touching way.There are many, many cameo roles in the film that though brief are extremely well delivered: Niels Arestrup is the wise grandfather to the young Emilie (Celine Buckens) who rescues Joey for a while; Toby Kebbell is excellent as Geordie Soldier as is David Kross as the kind German soldier Gunther whose younger brother Friedrich (Nicolas Bro) he protects, and Hinnerk Sch&ouml;nemann shines as the German solder who helps rescue Joey from the barbed wire in No Man's Land. Leonard Carow, Matt Milne, Robert Emms, and Eddie Marsan are likewise memorable.The breathtaking cinematography is by Janusz Kaminski and the at times lugubrious musical score is by longtime Spielberg associate, composer John Williams. The story aims for the heart and finds its mark - and there is nothing wrong with that.  Perhaps this film is much needed right now.  Grady Harp, April 12",1333584000,"04 5, 2012",5.0,1

"I was stunned, in the negative, the first time I saw this film with the 1942 narration. As another reviewer commented, I totally prefer the original longer version. One may argue editing decisions but a voice-over to substitute for title cards showed me that even Chaplin could make a very wrong-headed decision.There is a contemporary news show (maybe on FOX?) which has a segment where people read political cartoons using character voices. The practice doesn't come near the humor that can be experienced by our own reading in our minds. The same result happens with the Chaplin narration vs. our reading the title cards.Luckily the original version of ""The Gold Rush"" is included here.",1189555200,"09 12, 2007",5.0,1

"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie after reading so many good reviews about it. The theme also sounded like it would be fun and endearing and Jack Nicholson is one of my fav all time actors. What it ended up being was a huge disappointment.How anyone can call this movie ""hilarious"" or that Freeman and Nicholson had such ""good chemistry"" together, is a total mysteryThe acting seemed stilted and contrived, the two lead characters never seemed to bond as real friends.It's also VERY depressing with a lot of emphasis on the ""miracles"" of modern medicine that in the end were of no use to either of these men. As a person who lives a drug-free life, I was hoping this would be about giving the Grim Reaper a run for his money at the end, maybe a ""second chance"" for at least one of the characters, healthwise and with LOTS of laughs and funny scenes to enjoy.

"American International Picture's spy-themed 1965 follow-on to their successful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beach-Party-series/dp/B000PMFRXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beach Party series</a>&nbsp;does not measure up to its teen-fun predecessors nor its spy-film lampooning peers. Frankie Avalon and Dwayne Hickman each made better teen films, and though co-star Vincent price is a hoot and Susan Hart is hot, the screenplay is a dud. Worse yet, the script's original musical bent was trimmed down to only the terrific Guy Hemric/Jerry Styner-penned theme song. The film's low production values are mediated by great location footage of San Francisco and a terrific claymation title sequence by Gumby's creator, Art Clokey. Like any number of 1960s spy films - dramas and comedies - there's a lot of opportunity to pick out things Mike Myers poached for his Austin Powers series, not least of which are the gold bikini clad fembots. Lots of slapstick from the entire cast (which includes character actor Jack Mullaney), and some entertainingly bad green screen work in which Avalon and Hickman ride a motorbike amongst what seem to be gigantic trucks and cars. Keep your eye peeled for cameos from several AIP Beach Party stars. The original Beach Party films are better entertainment (particularly for their musical content) and better mid-60s spy spoofs can be found, but if you've exhausted both genres, see this one for completeness. Nice crisp print, but the original trailer is the only extra. [2009 hyperbolium dot com]",1246665600,"07 4, 2009",3.0,0

"I specifically didn't read any of the other reviews so I wouldn't be biased either way...But this movie was just ""meh"" to me.

I liked the strong central character and the ideas presented about warriors and how warriors can have what is essentially a common language against a common enemy.However, it just lacked in that ""it"" value that left it feeling a little shallow and disappointing.  Even thinking about it later it's hard to put a finger on it, and maybe it's something else with the characters or story line, or just a lack of overall effort.If you're looking for an ""ok"" movie and have a couple bucks, you'll at least get that out of it for a couple of hours.

"Roland Emmerich should have been making movies with Irwin Allen in the Seventies, given his delight in providing different ways to visualize New York and LA getting it. Here Emmerich doesn't even try for the tongue-in-cheek levity that saved ""Independence Day"" and attempted to (but could not possibly redeem) ""Godzilla""; everything is done with an absolutely straight face as the laws of physics and logic are broken repeatedly. The fact that he cast genuinely talented actors like Dennis Quaid, Sela Ward and jake Gyllenhaal to speak his wretched dialogue seems, paradoxically, actually to raise the camp factor considerably, as does the fact that this film is made with a genuine message. Global warming, we learn, is bad... spectacularly bad, of course. The resulting storms must naturally head for the world's two most important cities (according to Hollywood), New York and Los Angeles. We get to see various landmarks of these cities (like the Capitol Records building) obliterated, as if to prove that we are not in Kansas City or Milwaukee. The British royal family is also threatened, as if that were the only thing outside of the USA equivalent to the Hollywood sign or the Statue of Liberty. It's easy to scoff at Emmerich, but his films are not simply schlocky but also, fatally, incredibly visually unimaginative. Opportunities for at least some visual cleverness proliferate themselves throughout these films, and yet his expensive shots in this film of an oil tanker adrift along the flooded Fifth Avenue (for example) are not made to look to look beautiful or even remarkably absurd--just expensive.",1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2.0,-1

"Delhi Belly is a movie about three friends who are struggling in their careers and facing some vexing problems in their lives as well.  Tashi (Imran Khan) is a struggling journalist who us having second thoughts about his impending marriage to his girlfriend (Shehnaaz Treasurywallah), Nitin (Aditya Roy Kapoor ) is the friend who suffers from Delhi Belly and Arun ( Vir Das) is a cartoonist who has been dumped by his girlfriend. These are the friends and who are three friends who are struggling in their careers and facing some vexing problems in their lives as well. They share a dingy apartment in Delhi and have trouble making the rent, their lives are turned upside down when one of the accidently consumes a piece of Tandoori chicken from a street stand and finds himself suffering from the worst case of Delhi Belly. His stool sample is supposed to be anlysed by his doctor but gets incorrectly switiched with a parcel of diamonds. These regular people get on the list of one of the most dreaded gangsters in the city (Vijay Raaz)What works in the movie is the fact that although this movie is only 96 minutes long, each minute is full of surprises and there is never a dull moment. The director Abhinay Deo (the son of Ramesh and Seema Deo) is delivering on his promise to be one of the directors to watch out for. If you are offended by in your face vulgarity and cringe at excrement, oral sex, f-bombs, and violence, then this film is definitely not for you. Each of these cringe factors have been amplified and that is part of the reason that makes this movie entertaining.  In my opinion, Aditya Roy Kapoor and Vijay Raaz stole the show however each actor contributes. The music is ok, DK Bose or bhosedk as it means, has become the new anthem for the youth in India but it is not a great melody 3 stars. 7/8/2011",1310601600,"07 14, 2011",3.0,0

"""Rent"" is a thrilling, emotional experience on the stage: take it from someone who has seen the show on Broadway twice and in a primo road show version in Los Angeles starring Dougie Howser (Neil Patrick Harris) three times.But that was a number of years ago and though this Chris Columbus directed filmed version of ""Rent"" tries awfully hard to recapture the revolutionary feel of the new-to-Broadway-in-1994 subject matter (AIDS, drug addiction, etc.) and the re-writing and re-imagining of Puccini's ""La Boheme"" (by the super-talented Jonathan Larson)...it doesn't, though a couple of the scenes are knockouts: Mimi's (a dynamic, sultry, sexy Rosario Dawson) ""Out Tonight"" and the touching scene between Mimi and Roger (Adam Pascal) ""Light My Candle.""Overall there is a nagging feeling of been there done that about this entire film though once again I must re-iterate: the songs are first rate at least and glorious at best plus all the performers do a bang-up job of singing, acting and dancing.Unfortunately and frankly most of the performers are just too old for these parts: all of these actors were in the original Broadway production some 10 years ago. Remember this is a story about Gen X early twenty year olds and though they perform well: Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Anthony Rapp and Idina Menzel (Mark, Roger, Angel and Maureen) look like what they are, mid-thirty year olds. More importantly though, an essentially young person's concerns, problems and manner of looking at life juxtaposed onto someone who appears well into his or her 30's makes the characters pathetic and hopeless rather than tragic and hopeful and this friction irreparably damages the film to it's core.Sadly then, ""Rent"" is a disappointment: a case of a show with excellent bones whose body begs, really needs to be updated to transform it into as smartly cast, cogent, with-it, and profound as it was 10+ years ago.",1132876800,"11 25, 2005",3.0,0

"Other reviews tell you the basic story, so I won't go into that here.  My first problem with this episode is that like ""Homecoming"" and Deer Woman"" it just isn't scary.  This is from the Masters of Horror collection, so I was expecting fear, and it just wasn't there.  We've seen this type story done before, most notably in Cronenberg's the Fly and Walas's The Fly II, so the new angle is the character's are lesbians.  What they are missing is chemistry.  Why is Misty infatuated with Ida?  Is she the only lesbian she's ever met?  Performances are all amateurish.  Ida (Bettis) seems to be channeling Joan Cusack on a bad day.  McKee's direction must have been to tell her to talk slowly.  Misty (Brown) in contrast talks fast, running sentences together.  Okay, they're opposites, I get it, but I don't believe (in this case) that they attract.  I did like the artistic dream sequence and some of the humor when Misty begins to change, but I would think that someone's lover would notice when goo starts spurting out of their paramour's ear.  The other actors aren't given much to do.  We know who is going to die and they're death's are pretty well telegraphed ahead.

"Sole Survivor (Thom Eberhardt, 1983)When you watch as many movies as I do, some of the more forgettable ones are bound to fall through the cracks. This one caught my eye today, sitting there on the shelf, and I swore I'd watched it within the past couple of months, but couldn't find a note about it anywhere in my film notebook. So I popped it in and watched the first few minutes. Yep, looked familiar. So I skipped round a bit watching more and more of it and remembering. But I couldn't for the life of me remember how it ended. So I fast-forwarded and watched the last five minutes again. And now I know why I didn't remember the movie; the ending is so horribly stupid that I must have actively blocked the experience of watching this low-budget (estimated $350,000) dog that I can't believe wasn't a made-for-TV movie (it may have been, but IMDB doesn't list it that way) from my mind. It's not that the rest of the movie is as bad as the ending, it's just that it doesn't have anywhere near enough redeeming qualities to balance out the deathless stupidity of that final, unintentionally hilarious scene.The plot will be very familiar to anyone who's seen David Hemmings' adaptation of James Herbert's wonderful novel The Survivor, the film version of which came out two years before this: a plane crashes, leaving (surprise!) one survivor, Denise Watson (Girlfriends' Anita Skinner in her second and last film role). After the accident, her therapist asks her about survivors' guilt, but she professes not to feel it. However, she starts seeing people whom she eventually realizes are ghosts of the victims, whom she believes have come to take her back to the grave with them. She tries to avoid this fate with the help of a sympathetic cop (Brian Richardson), who believes, of course, that there's a rational explanation for all this.It's a pretty good plot (and one wonders why, in the age of American remakes of Japanese ghost stories, no one has got round to giving this one a revamp), but it's got that vintage-seventies TV-disaster-movie feel to it that pretty much guarantees a forgettable experience (and given that the movie was released in 1983, pretty much guarantees it was already feeling dated when it came out). Skinner is a relatively decent actress (""relatively"" to the rest of the cast, anyway), but she never gets across the feeling that she's actually in danger, and that seems as if it would be important in a supernatural thriller, no? So you go along, half falling asleep while watching this, and then all the sudden you're blindsided by that final scene, the contents of which I obviously can't reveal, but my god, is it funny. It's almost worth sitting through the rest of the movie just to get to the laughs at the end. It's really, really terrible, but in such a way that it almost makes this transcend its insipidity and enter the realm of such bad-movie classics as Shriek of the Mutilated and Night of the Lepus (which, despite being so very very awful, are two of my all-time favorite movies for that very reason). It doesn't get there, and the lack of unintentional humor anywhere but that last scene doesn't help, but man, that final shot? It's a killer. You've gotta see it just for that. * ",1242950400,"05 22, 2009",2.0,-1

"Rest in peace, Paul Walker.You were taken from us too early. To those who knew you, you were a charismatic, down-to-earth, friendly guy; you made an indelible impression on those you met.

You were the emotional core of the Fast and Furious franchise, the everyman in Eight Below, the riveting protagonist of Running Scared.You gave to charity, you posed for pictures, you were a role model for fans. You were a great guy who never got caught up in the celebrity image. The action world will never be the same without you. Yours is a hole that can never be filled.We miss you, Paul.

He was in the midst of a nervous breakdown after the death of his wife, and it is obvious in his face during the mosntrous two hours.  I care not a wick for the story, I simply could not tear my eyes off of Brett's stricken and woebegone face.  He looked so tired, so utterly tired of the role he has played for a decade.  It was indeed cruel to have him come back into this role at that point in his life.  He is so talented, so brilliant in his works of the past.  I cannot stress that enough.  Watch this movie and tell me he is not a suffering man!  God rest his soul, we all miss this actor of unmistakeable calibur.  I shall miss you, Mr. Brett.",1076803200,"02 15, 2004",2.0,-1

"The title well describes this film --- it's 73 minutes focused on 2 youthful men who are rather silent most of the time. That said, it's not necessarily a bad film, it's just different, but it won't leave most viewers immersed either.The story centers around 2 college age students who have a passing encounter which leads to a friendship (of sorts) which leads to some romantic embraces. There is some conversation along the way, none very deep, and that pretty much wraps up this 73 minute film.  There is but one provocative line, but you'll have to get to the end to hear it for yourself.On the plus side, the characters are generally likable, and the story line is delicate (many can certainly relate to these 'first time' encounters).  The film quality and acting are good but at times I felt the production was more focused on the visual landscapes than actually telling a story.  If you're looking for a tender slow moving story of two young men coming of age, with little dialogue, limited depth and very little sexual energy, you'll probably like the film.On the contrary, this was definitely one of my least favorite films, and I would not watch it again nor suggest it to friends as a must see (or even a ""you would really like it"").  There is not much of a plot, and there is very little depth to the characters.  The lack of dialog is frustrating, not artistic.  I can understand the 1-star review, though the 5-star ones are a bit too kind in my opinion.  I rated it 3 stars vs. 2 simply because it delivered what it advertises (read the product description  - it's accurate).The statement ""awkwardly sitting across from each other not knowing what to say"" pretty much sums up my opinion after watching the movie.  To that end, the writers / producers / actors delivered what they promised.  However, I have seen far better coming of age films that while delicate had far more substance.",1427673600,"03 30, 2015",3.0,0

"Saw this movie at the Gateway Theater in Columbus, OH as it is currently in limited release. Huge fan of Kurt Russell and thought this would be a nice segue into ""The Hateful Eight"", his major movie scheduled for release on Christmas day. The poster looks like a cool, little western; doesn't give away much. Boy, was I in for a surprise! It starts out like a traditional Western: some townsfolk are kidnapped by a mysterious band of renegades, and a posse made up of the sheriff, his old deputy, an arrogant, indian-hating aristocratic gunslinger and the husband of the kidnapped woman set out on a rescue mission. Admittedly, the middle 1/3 was a bit slow, but never dragged, using the time to really develop the characters. The dialog was interesting, original and had a rhythm all its own. The 4 main actors were awesome, but Richard Jenkins as the ""back-up"" deputy steals the show, not an easy feat with Kurt Russell at the top of his acting game. And when the rescue party (or what's left of them) finally reaches the caves...well, hang on to your barf bag, cause it'll kick you in the gut. This is the kind of movie rarely seen in American theaters anymore. Well worth seeking out.",1445817600,"10 26, 2015",5.0,1

"Yes, it's another movie about an adopted child (that no one wants for a good reason) who turns out to be a bit of a handful. The structure of the story is a bit different in that we have a displaced partial family temporarily staying with an Uncle in his wrecking yard in a desert that is just the right distance from civilization for strange things to happen. So the family tries to pull itself together without the father who had died earlier they also bring in an adoptee who acts as a provocateur in exposing each individual's issues. As the movie progresses you develop the sense that if anyone dies - who cares.The acting by Sofia Vassilieva (the adopted little monster of course) stood out and seemed to carry the suspense as she played people against each other.As far as the rest of the movie their was nothing special about the directing, editing, filming or script - not great, not bad. However, there were two problems: First, it's another of those movies where you wonder how the script writers and director ever make it through life if the dumb choices of the movie's actors is any reflection upon them. Second, the final 15 minutes or so was like watching a cliff diver's sterling entrance only to end up doing a belly flop at the end. Just a total disaster of an ending - a belly flop. It's as if the creativity was depleted by the time the finale approached, or they were running out of money.",1314748800,"08 31, 2011",3.0,0

"This is a very accurate portrayal of Scott Fitzgerald's last days as he struggles to create the novel The Last Tycoon under the eye of a youthful secretary who basically must become his housewife.  The story is not only about writing, but about a talented man's struggle to maintain his decency and integrity after totally blowing out his personality with a monstrous addiction to alcohol.  He mainly succeeds, not always, but it is the sort of thing which ought to be shown at AA meetings.Scott was eccentric to start with, of course.  His institutionalized wife Zelda comes into his view in flashbacks that look like demented alcoholic dreams, in which Zelda is interestingly interpreted by Sissy Spacek.  Nave Campbell's portrayal of the secretary is great, and Irons' inhabitation of Fitzgerald very shrewd, going for essences, and entirely convincing.  This is one of those rare movies which convincingly grapples with the creative process, even as it survives under impossible circumstances.  Highly recommended.",1223856000,"10 13, 2008",5.0,1

Kay (Meryl Streep) and Arnold (Tommy Lee Jones) married for 31 years. Their marriage is getting stale and they are becoming more like business partners. Kay wants the magic back and forces Arnold to go and intensive course with Doctor Feld (Steve Carell.)Actually the actors look a little better with some age on them. The primes are not that interesting. The excision is mechanical. It looked like each character was acting by his/her self and they just patched it together to make a film. It's like watching Dr. Phil on steroids.The film starts to get repetitive and then just quits.,1384300800,"11 13, 2013",1.0,-1

"When I was renting a few videos they said I could grab two more to get the cheaper rental deal they had going, and I had glanced at this films cover when selecting the others in the horror movie section, and I figured, ""what the hell""When I first put it on, the story of camp councilors in the woods telling ghost stories of a psychopath that was killed out there and then returned to take his revenge on those that let him die sounded all too familiar (ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma)Even hearing the heroin's murdered brother of the movie was named Jason. And their friend Mike (Myers was it?) seemed to be really pushing the limits to me either saying, ""this is a cheesy fan made horror movie of the slasher genre, or a complete rip off of Friday The 13th. [not to forget, a Jason type of mask is worn for a prank]However, even tho I would definitely say this is the creators version of a Friday The 13th film, by the time it ended, I thought it was not too bad, and one of the better copycat type of films for this genre.The plot of the movie is about some councilors who have just finished looking after the kids for the summer, the children have gone home and there sticking around for the last couple of days to pack up the campsite to go home. They tell a story of Trevor Moorhouse, who was killed by councilors and came back to seek his revenge.I guess that might have been the plot of the first movie, which I have not seen. So hopefully I will be able to track that one down and see if it was as good as it's sequel. After this ghost story, the councilors don't believe the story, except for one of them, but they soon find themselves in jeopardy in the typical slasher stalks them in the woods and cabins motif.While it is a copy-cat of Friday The 13th, it portrays it in it's own way, not copying every element that makes that slasher series and instead of just using the kill for the hell of killing plot, you get to know these characters better then a Friday The 13th movie where it's all ""no one will help us, we have to do it ourselves"" to a more believable scenario.The gore fans may enjoy some of the bloody kills in this. For a low budget movie that starts off looking like a cheap copy-cat independent film eventually involves into an entertaining horror/thriller with plenty of action, suspense and a ""who done it"" that was not the most predictable thing for you to work out.I did not figure out who the killer was till the end scenes, so it may take you a while to figure it out too. However, If I was making this movie, I might have gone for a better ending, or more drawn out. It seemed to be pretty quick, and that's about the only downfall of the movie.However, I still give it 4 stars It was pretty entertaining, the characters aren't the annoying airheads you usually find in these slasher films that just say something stupid, don't believe what's going on, show there naked body and get gutted.Tho as usual, it does go for some unneeded nudity, at least it's only the one woman, and not every one of them leaving you thinking, ""God, is this how the expected to get people to see this with an actor who can't act but shows her breasts at the drop of a hat?""Overall, I think the Friday The 13th fans like myself will see it's not a direct rip off, but more a nod to those movies, and says clearly, ""this was made by a fan of slasher movies, but it's done pretty well""",1214697600,"06 29, 2008",3.0,0

"The Gift is a reasonably suspenseful movie, although not a particularly surprising one. Quite a bit of the suspense drifts away before the final scenes, which are too predictably feel-good for my taste. Everything resolves too easily at the endWhat I like about The Gift, however, are the performances. Whenever Ive seen Jason Bateman, hes played a likable guy. Maybe Ive missed edgier performances, but in The Gift he plays a total a-hole so convincingly that I cant believe hes ever played anything but an a-hole. Its a subtle, completely believable performance.The other actors are also quite good, and I like the movies look. So maybe not the greatest story, but still a movie worth watching for some strong performances.",1475798400,"10 7, 2016",4.0,1

"I decided to give this DVD a try due to my longtime muskuloskeletal disorders, as well as my determination to stay away from the pharma industry and their drugs, which to me, have been useless if not dangerous. I have a history of lumbago, bursitis and neck problems. Several years ago, I had sciatica that lasted for almost 7 years. It was then that I knew without a doubt there was absolutely nothing conventional allopathic medicine (therapy and dangerous drugs included) could do for me. Though a series of sessions with a good chiropractor provided relief, it was thanks to meditation and mind control that I finally completely got over my sciatica. Now I have been sciatica free for 15 years, but I would often have neck and back pain problems due to bad posture or tension, and two or three years ago I also started having pain on my upper left arm. Depending how high and in which direction I raised my left arm, a sharp pain would remind me something was seriously wrong with it. My low back pain was also there. Whenever I had to stand in the kitchen for more than 20 minutes chopping veggies or preparing a meal, I had to take a rest and sit down for a while due to discomfort or pain on my lower back. Only a few months ago, I came on Amazon and saw this DVD and ordered it right away. I started by watching the tape very carefully two or three times, trying not to miss any detail in order to follow Master Chris Pei's instructions as faithfully as I could. The results are next to miraculous. I could feel energized right after my very first session. Five of six sessions later, I realized that my left arm was not aching any more.  The next day, when I got on my Pilates machine to do some strength training, I realized I could raise my left arm as high as I wanted without any pain whatsoever. I was free of my lower back pain in about only 8 or 10 sessions. Thanks to QiGong, I can now stand at the kitchen countertop for as long as I want, with no pain. I can move my left arm, back and forth, high and low, with no pain. I have read two or three books on QiGong and there is one concept that I found very interesting. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, there is only ONE illness: Qi stagnation. This means that if the Qi flows freely, we are also free from disease. QiGong has worked so fantastically well for me, that I have every reason to support that belief. Thanks to QiGong, I am 100% pain free.*{Master Chris Pei's instructions are crystal clear and to the point. Bravo!}Note: In relation with other reviews, I must say that QiGong is not only about movement. It also requires strong involvement of the subconscious mind or, in other words, it involves meditation, or getting the mind to reach, at least, the Alpha level. It is for that reason that I think these exercises should better be practiced AFTER watching the DVD, not at the same time. Master Chris Pei, is obviously not in the Beta level (conscious mind level) at the time he performs the movements.UPDATE. September 6, 2012Later I found Dr Yang Ywing Ming' s DVDs here on Amazon which, in my opinion (together with Master Chris Pei's DVDs) are also among the BEST DVDs one can get to practice and learn about QiGong. I have ALL of Dr Yang's DVDs on QiGong and will continue to buy every DVD Both Chris Pei and Dr Yang may come up with in the future. I have the whole DVD series ""Understanding Qigong"" by Dr Yang. Each DVD is about 3 hours long and is a wonderful tool for those of us who not only want to practice Qigong but also understand the reasons why we should practice it and the best ways to do so.Another Update: June 2013I have continued practicing Qigong, mainly Chris Pei's and Dr Yang's DVDs and I have no words to express all the benefits that I am getting through its practice.",1312675200,"08 7, 2011",5.0,1

A tying record 11 Academy Awards.  Now Leonardo and Kate re-team in a new movie, Revolutionary Road, directed by Sam Mendes (then married to Kate Winslet, divorced in 2010).  April (Kate Winslet) and Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) meet at a party in the 1950's. They dance and become involved. She wants to be an actress.  Now 7 years later, we see that conversation between the two married couple gets quite heated. She doesn't wish to discuss her bad night in the play. He keeps harping on her about it.  The next morning, while Frank goes to work at the firm, April begins to recall how their marriage has been.  She remembers when Helen (Kathy Bates) first showed them the quaint Connecticut house on Revolutionary Hill.  This is Frank's 30th birthday, he is bored with his job and his family life. He has an affair with a co-worker, Zoe (Maureen Grube).  At home, his wife decides to become a more understanding wife and surprises him with a birthday cake and their two children at her side.  She has another idea to present to him.  My thoughts: I enjoyed seeing Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet working together again and hope they will consider doing another movie together in the near future.

"Iron Man 3 was a step in a better direction then Iron Man 2.  Except the movie felt generic, bland, and lackluster.  The movies story was mediocre, just enough to move the movie along.  Then it felt like certain action sequences were added for the sake of action sequences.For non comic fans the switch with the Mandarin not being a real villain, simply an actor may have been okay.  Unfortunately I know a bit about the Mandarin and he is one of the best villains for Iron Man.  Which was disappointing that he was wasted in the manner he was.However even with the movies mishaps Robert Downey Jr. delivers another performance to life.  The movie was vastly entertaining and enjoyable.  The humor and action were placed correctly, in a way that the movie doesn't feel long.  Which make it a fun movie to go see.When the movie is done you won't be like ""Whoa! That was amazing"" or ""Whoa! What a horrible movie.""  You'll be left somewhere in the middle, where you won't be sorry you saw it but it isn't anything to write home about either.  It was a step in the right direction for the character though hopefully it continues to get better and doesn't turn into Iron Man 2.",1384473600,"11 15, 2013",3.0,0

"This is a rubbish movie.The characters are stereotypical card board cut outs. Rigid Asian guy, outlandish Greek kid, dumb blonde, religous pale girl, stoner... list goes onIts amateurish to see this kind of stuff, and all the more baffling given it was an adaptation from literature.It actually annoyed me to see the lead female fall in love with the lifeless average looking asian kid. Oh... but wait.. the kid mouths off like some fortune cookie every once in a while and she gets all google eyed about it. Im not trying to be racist. Im trying to highlight the stereotypes. Surely they could find a more fitting Asian kid to play this part. Maybe some kid with a bit of charm... as to not want to bang your head against the wall when he pulls the John Travolta on her while the whole darn town is going up in flames, ""whats wrong, you don't like me""... No kiddo how can we make this clear... ""my friggn parents are laying waste in a war camp, I just gunned down three people last night and oh yeh... I haven't had any sleep cause I had to save your sorry a$$ from a flesh wound""Oh boy, its a just so damn juvenile.Not to mention the ridiculous action scenes. Machine guns firing a bucket load of rounds at a tractor for 15 minutes... ""it blew one of the tyres!""Has anyone on the set even tried to shoot an AK-47 or similar. The religious girl mows down a group of soldiers like she's watering the garden... pffft... the kickback with her rambo-esque blaze of glory (short burst people... Call of Duty anyone?) would have sent her up in the air. Not to mention the accuracy on this girl from 50 metres out, sporting the machinery like she was fronting for Led Zepplin.Then you have the completely inappropriate humour during completely inappropriate times. Arnold Shwarzenneger style one liners... Driving a tractor, theres still a military buggy spraying them with live ammunition.. but lets have a KIT KAT moment and say... ""your dangerous behind the wheel...LOL"".... pffftTHe constant fistful of disbelief makes this film cringe worthy.

"My wife makes fun of me for shushing the kids so I can hear ""cartoons"". I quickly correct her, ""Superman - Doomsday is not a 'cartoon.' It's an 'animated feature film.'"" This clarification for some reason always seems to bring on even more chuckles over a bottle of wine with friends than it does clarify the matter.Anyway, My kids were as captivated as I was for Superman - Doomsday. What is with the PG-13 rating of Superman - Doomsday?...I remember a couple of scenes in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Finding-Nemo/dp/B00005JM02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Finding Nemo</a>&nbsp;that were more intense for young children, but Nemo gets a G rating. I'll tell ya, I think that the MPAA needs a rating themselves. That would be an 'F'. Rest assured, Superman - Doomsday is definitely for kids too unless you shield your kids from the same kinds of intensity that can be found in the most intense chapters of Nemo and other Disney G-rated classics.Now, on the other side of the coin...Doomsday does viciously do away with some of the folks that cross his path. So a little Parental Guidance could be in order for kids 7 and under. But any 10 year old that needs Parental Guidance for Superman - Doomsday doesn't get out much.Superman - Doomsday isn't quite as well put together as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League/dp/B000CSTK3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League)</a>&nbsp;series, but it was pretty good. I don't follow the comic book series, but I understand that there are some continuity issues between this movie and the DC Comics...most notably the origin of Doomsday. But the story told on the DVD held up, and was pretty cool.LexCorp's minions find an alien craft in some mine and accidentally unleash Doomsday (an ugly looking monster) from the craft. The monster wreaks havoc; Superman comes to the rescue; and the result could be a dramatic change in a World that is used to having Superman around to protect everyone.It is not necessary to have ever seen a Justice League episode or read a DC Superman comic book to enjoy the Superman - Doomsday DVD. On the contrary...familiarity with the comic books or TV series might hinder your viewing pleasure based on the varying continuity factors.Final word: sit back and enjoy. And don't forget to provide that all-important Parental Guidance for the kids that have never seen the 6 o'clock news.",1194912000,"11 13, 2007",3.0,0

"My 4-yr old was into this movie.

"Two stars from the comedy film ""Road Trip"" -- D.J.Qualls and Rachel Blanchard (also famous as 'Cher' in TV's ""Clueless"") -- reunite for another journey to find the meaning of life.  But this film is not a comedy.  The new flavor added to this film is that Quall's character Neil is not a geekish student introduced for laugh; just see Neil's favorite book, which is J.D.Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye,"" and this film is as serious as the cynical protagonist of that book, Holden Caulfield.""Chasing Holden"" starts with an interesting premise.  After short stint at an institute, Neil (who happens to be a son of governor of New York State) comes to a posh prep school where he is given an assignment by his English teacher (Sean Kanan, also writer of the iflm): ""Write your own idea of what happened to Holden after the book ended.""  Can you do that?  Holden as an adult?  Holden working for some company?Intriguing but impossible, I guess.  Holden should be eternally the symbol of rebellious youth, you know that.  So, Neil writes a letter to the author himself requesting the answer or clues, while as we know that Mr. Salinger has been refusing any contact with interviewers.In the meanwhile, Neil becomes acquainted with a lovely and good-natured girl 'T.J.'  T.J. understands him and his feelings, and in the middle of the night they leave the small town and its oppressive establishment behind, seeking for freedom.  And the first place to go is, New York City.I can say that this film is well-intentioned.  Neil is too absorbed in the fictional character, and using this setting, the film's script seems to be trying to make an intelligent statement about this now classic book of American literature.  Yes, I read that book when I was young, and I loved it, but not as much as Neil did.  Suppose you got a life like Holden ... and suppose you know that too real.  What would you do?But, despite the good acting from the two leading actors, the whole result of the film is confusing and very weak.  I point out only one mistake of the film: too many clithed episodes of the story.  There are so many of them that in the middle of the story we forget Neil's original purpose of meeting the author Salinger.  There is a gun unwisely stolen; there is a father who neglects his son, and so on.  You know there is a secret the girl hides, and to make it worse, you know that too soon.And I found the conclusion too incredible.  One famous musician's life also somehow crept into the script, but its effort to wrap up the initially interesting story is far-fetched and unacceptable.  The answer Neil gets after so many adventures is too obvious from the first -- like I said, it's something like a grown-up Holden.  Nobody sees him, and nobody knows him.  And like that idea, ""Chasing Holden"" is just too impossible -- except when Mr. Salinger shows up and tells HIS own story.  That's the only way you can do ""Chasing Holden.""",1053216000,"05 18, 2003",2.0,-1

"BOTTOM LINE: A legendarily awful yuletide motion picture, fully deserving of its Ed Woodian reputation. An amazingly wretched relic from the good old days. Proof that drugs & alcohol are often used on motion picture sets, (and strongly recommended for those of you at home contemplating watching this of your own free will). Let the tinsel-trimmed torture begin! 5 STARSTHE STORY: The listless children of Mars just sit and sulk, much to the confusion & consternation of their parents. Consulting with their high priest, the Red Planet's leaders are informed that their computer-taught & chemically-controlled children are essentially being denied their childhood. If such a joyless existence is allowed to continue, in another generation or two the entire Martian race faces extinction! Simply put: the depressed tots are in desperate need of fun & happiness! What to do? Why... kidnap Santa Claus, of course! (?) To accomplish this task, a rocketship of stealthy Martian commandos is sent to Earth. Once there, the Martian meanies strongarm a couple of precocious Earth children into pointing the way to Santa's Workshop. After some not too perilous peril, involving a rabid polar bear attack & the mechanical menace of the Martians' robotic enforcer, Torg, the two kids & jolly old Saint Nick are whisked away to the Red Planet, instructed to cheer up the mundane lives of all the sad Martian kiddies.... or else!THOUGHTS: As mainstream moves go, SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS surely must rank as one of the oddest ever made. The entire cast is made up of unknowns, except for a young pre-celebrity Pia Zadora, as Martian tyke, Girmar, and Ned Wertimer, as KID-TV reporter Andy Henderson. (Wertimer's main claim to fame was portraying Ralph, the eternally-shafted doorman on The Jeffersons). All of the actors play the film completely straight-faced, with nary an eye-roll nor stifled giggle to be found. Astonishing, considering the ridiculous costumes, totally unconvincing make-ups and thoroughly atrocious ""special effects"" the film contains. (All of which would be right at home in a typical third grade Christmas play.) Seriously, one need only look as far as the 'terrifying' polar bear and ""Torg"" the Martian robot henchman, to see that the film's total F/X budget couldn't have exceeded $125, tops. Still, the movie somehow manages to be entertaining, in a twisted sort of fever dream/train wreck way. It's better viewed in the terrific Mystery Science Theater 3000 version, which is perhaps their best holiday effort. (Although it's a close tie with their lampooning of the Mexican-lensed Christmas catastrophe, ""Santa Claus."") Viewed as-is, SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS takes a strong will (or some strong drink) to make it through in one setting. Very young children, undoubtedly the target audience of this film, may well enjoy it. Anyone over the age of six or seven will likely be reaching for the remote or an air sick bag (or both).THE BLU-RAY: While not an ultra-sharp frame-by-frame restoration, this film, (up until now consigned to faded, washed out, jittery junk quality Public Domain copies), looks better than it has in years, perhaps since its theatrical debut. It's not as good as it could look, but it's likely due to the condition of whatever source materials Horizon/Kino Lorber had to work with. The video still contains a fair amount of debris and grit, but far less than I've seen in previous PD releases. Thankfully the color palette here is quite strong in comparison to the wretched PD stuff. Audio is a mostly clear & level mono. An eclectic assortment of bonus goodies round out this Blu-ray release. Best of the bunch is the compilation of theatrical bumpers, shorts and holiday-related bits touted as ""The Retro Holiday Film Festival."" There's also a cute Fleisher Christmas cartoon, some old commercials and a short Howdy Doody clip. Pretty neat stuff.",1486771200,"02 11, 2017",5.0,1

"Rented this the other night and was completely blown away.  I knew the general idea of the movie-Pride & Prejudice + 21st Century India + Bollywood--but had not seen either any other Bollywood style movie or Gurinder Chadha's big hit, Bend it Like Beckham.I absolutely loved this movie, nearly everything about it from the music and dancing in the musical numbers (which break out at random intervals) to the acting to the intertwining stories of romance and heartbreak.  Standout actors were the incredible Aishwarya Rai (Lalita) and the comic relief of Nitin Ganatra as Mr. Kholi, the gauche returnee from America shopping for a bride.It was also lovely to see Naveen Andrews outside of ""Lost"" and just wish there could have been a bit more of him and his storyline with Lalita's sister.The movie is in English but sometimes when the speech gets rolling quickly, the accents can make a scene a bit hard to follow, but since I want to watch this movie again and again I will get it all eventually.  Or you can do what I do sometimes when I have trouble following thick Aussie or British accents on a DVD--turn on the subtitles.For someone like me unfamiliar with Bollywood and the amazingly beautiful AND talented Aishwarya Rai, this is a great introduction to both, and like me, I'll bet that you will want to see more of both.  The exuberant music and dancing are what stayed with me the most from this movie, and I think that queuing up the opening wedding dance scene or the ""No Life Without Wife"" number will cheer me up on any grumpy day.This movie is a keeper for me--I'm buying both the DVD and the soundtrack.",1130803200,"11 1, 2005",5.0,1

"This documentary commemorating the closing of this musical after 42 years in NYC is only an hour long, so it may seem pricey unless you are a Fantasticks Fanatic. However, if you have a special fondness for the work, as I have, you must at least rent this. My relationship with the show began in 1962, when my college was one of the very first to get the rights to stage a production away from New York. Joining our drama department's cast of talented students and faculty members was an actor who had just finished playing the boy, Matt, at Sullivan Street. I think his name was Jack Black (no, not the current Jack Black.) I was the drama and film critic for my college paper at the time. The show just stunned me, and I have been a sucker for it ever since. I never got to Manhattan to see it in its original setting, but I have watched half-a-dozen productions in the past 40 years in four states. This DVD is a very nice tribute, featuring the people responsible for the music, the lyrics, the script and the staging.

"This film is a dreadful attempt at producing a supernatural thriller pitting the forces of good (God) against evil (Satan).  This script is abominable.  The story is utterly unimaginative in its premise and the dialogue is incredibly bad.  The behavior of the characters, especially Maggie (Kim Basinger) is often incongruous and sometimes ludicrous.The story is about a modern second coming of Christ, with the little Christ girl being born to a drug addict (Angela Bettis) and left with her Aunt Maggie.  The child is being sought out by the disciples of Satan with the intention of converting her to the dark side or killing her.  The army of inept devil worshipers keeps kidnapping her and our mousy heroine single handedly keeps outwitting them and stealing her back followed by interminable car chases pursued by a stretch limo.  Meanwhile, a group of nuns gets together and prays aloud that God will protect Maggie and the child in one of the film's most laughable scenes.  All this culminates in a showdown between God and Satan including some lame visual effects.A number of reputable actors are wasted on this hack script.  Jimmy Smits is a good actor who gives his standard solid cop portrayal.  Kim Basinger can be excellent in the right role.  She is good in sexy roles, certain dramatic roles and has even proven to be an effective comedian at times.  However, an action heroine she is not and will never be.  The most convincing performance is given by Angela Bettis as Jenna, who looked genuinely strung out on heroine.Supernatural thrillers provide unlimited possibilities for creativity and imagination.  This pedestrian script is a trite treatment of a familiar story that is poorly written and directed.  I rated it a 3/10.  If you are intent on seeing a ridiculous supernatural thriller see ""End Of Days"" with Arnold Schwarzenegger.  At least you will get some good action footage with your tripe.",982713600,"02 21, 2001",2.0,-1

"Maria di Rohan (1843) is Donizetti's last ""melodrammi"" opera before his tabes death in 1848. (one more opera-comic also aired in 1843). Maria is in advanced form as a more ""through"" composed composition and less of the classic Italian ""numbers"" work with set arias and recitatives. And the drama is ""high"" drama from Maria's first act ""Cupa fatal mestizia...."", then the dramatic end of the act with the supposed fall of Cardinal Richelieu, and then the truly exciting and beautiful grand finale of Act 2 duet between Maria and her lover Count Riccardo to the final of act three when her husband the Duke  Enrico curses her to ""vivo non t'e concesso""  a life of remorse after her lover shoots himself to death. Things are hot and heavy in this fast paced action piece. The part of Maria is very well developed in the opera and is well served by Majella Cullagh vocally - though she is not a born actress. Her husband Enrico di Chevreuse, the Duke, is a very well written baritone part and it is done with great artistry by Marco di Felice. Her lover Riccardo, Conte di Chalais is a fine tenor role and shows off the lyric voice of Salvatore Cordella. There is so much fine music here that all the leads as well as the chorus and orchestra can show off their artistry to great acclaim. This includes the conductor, former tenor, Gregory Kunde who kept a tight rein of the orchestra. As many times as I've played this disc I'm still thrilled by the intensity of the opera as a whole and the final curse of the wronged Duke on his innocent wife Maria. It's a great show!The production is inoffensive modernist tight budget with a few sillinesses but it serves. The women all get one costume for all three acts. The men at least get to wear their shirt out of they've been wounded in a duel of which there are many. But the ladies including Maria get only one sweaty velvet gown for the whole show.The setting is 1620s France during the reign of Louis XIII with Cardinal Richelieu as Prime Minister . Before act 1 opens Duke Enrico di Chevreuse, Maria's secret husband has killed the Cardinal's nephew in a duel. Curtain up..............The score used here is that used at the opera's premier 5 June 1843 at the Karntnertortheater, Vienna.. Later that year Donizetti revised it for Paris and then revised it for Naples etc etc. Fortunately the Donizetti Festival in Bergamo used the original Vienna version.  and that is what is on this recording.Maria di Rohan was a real person in history and judging by her portrait was quite a handsome women. She is also mentioned in the Three Musketeers.",1440720000,"08 28, 2015",5.0,1

"Ah, ""Gymkata."" For how many years had I heard about this film before actually watching it for myself? Obviously too many, since the movie didn't match my growing expectations. As a guy who doesn't let the opinions of (many) people sway his decisions of what to watch, I disregarded the critiques and LOLs of folks who've bashed this movie, believing that even if the film was incredibly goofy, it might sate me with some nice action scenes like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender/dp/B0002848WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat, No Surrender</a>&nbsp;did. Sadly, this was not the case: ""Gymkata"" is merely plain goofy, as opposed to incredibly goofy, and its action content - despite being unusual - doesn't really hit the spot. Succinctly, it's not nearly as entertaining as I had hoped for.The story: champion gymnast Jonathan Cabot (real-life gymnastics champ Kurt Thomas) is selected by the US government to act as their entry to a deadly contest organized by the tiny, violent monarchy-nation of Parmistan to decide which country will have rights to its strategic missile defense site.The movie actually draws on the actual, controversial ""Star Wars"" missile defense system from the 1980s as a major plot point, so one's personal politics and opinion of history might weigh in to your impression of the movie. Me, I'm just disappointed that the producers went with such a contrived plot to begin with: though the screenplay is loosely adapted from Dan Tyler Moore's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/novel/dp/B000FA9B6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">novel </a>&nbsp;about an isolated nation subjecting outsiders to grisly contests, the film's theatrical trailer focuses almost entirely on its namesake - the gymnastics-karate hybrid martial art gymkata (not actually mentioned by name in the movie). This concept is interesting enough, if you ask me, and director Robert Clouse's best-known picture -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enter-the-Dragon/dp/B004GJYRKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enter the Dragon</a>&nbsp;- proves that he works best with simple storylines. The movie rushes through both character and story development to get to its forced premise of a pseudo-medieval country that its coherency suffers: there's just too much story here for a 90-minute feature, and a lot of its subsequent weirdness is the result of minimal or nonexistent exposition.I'm not sure what to make of Kurt Thomas. On one hand, he's not a great actor and clearly no martial artist, but I'm nevertheless disappointed by the critical bashing the film received: along with his nomination for a Razzie Award, this probably deterred him from pursuing many more movie roles, despite what I perceive as promising potential. His athleticism is unquestionable, and even though some of the physical setups we see here are crude and heavy-handed, the gratuitous flipping and acrobatic moves foreshadow the style of action that future Hong Kong and Thai pictures would bring to cinema. More disappointingly, the presence of legitimate martial arts movie stars is, for the most part, wasted: Tadashi Yamashita (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Ninja/dp/B00005N89J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Ninja</a>) and John Barrett (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Kickboxer/dp/B000AYEL1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Kickboxer</a>) don't fight at all, and Hong Kong veterans Conan Lee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tiger-on-Beat/dp/630526144X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tiger on Beat</a>) and Richard Norton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-Hunter/dp/B00008WJE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City Hunter</a>) only get one so-so fight apiece.

I really don't know whether Robert Clouse purposely sought out increasingly goofy projects like this after his work with Bruce Lee or just got (un)lucky, but when it comes to weirdness, this is definitely one of his weirdest. ""Gymkata"" isn't awful by B-movie standards but it's also not great, for better or worse. It'd be great to see an updated version of this with fight choreography that was more sure of itself, but beyond that, I'm glad I settled for a rental with this one.",1343520000,"07 29, 2012",3.0,0

"Agatha Christie's renowned Belgian detective resolves yet another slate of atmospheric British-themed crimes! Here is a synopsis of each episode. (I've rendered my own relative evaluation of each one on a 1-10 scale, 10 being the best):VOLUME 1 (Disc One)The Million-Dollar Bond Robbery -- At the behest of bank officials, Poirot and Hastings accompany a bank representative who is notorious for his gambling on the Queen Mary across the Atlantic to America -- the bank's assets are clearly in jeopardy of being stolen. But Poirot never gets to debark from the ship as the bank's bonds have apparently disappeared along the route so it's back to England in an attempt to solve the mystery. [ 7.5]The Plymouth Express -- Christie enthusiasts will recognize this yarn as being loosely based upon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mystery-of-the-Blue-Train-Hercule-Poirot-Series/dp/0594035503/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mystery of the Blue Train (Hercule Poirot Series)</a>. A financial magnate's daughter is experiencing ex-husband difficulties just prior to re-kindling an old flame with a nefarious French Count. She journeys away in a train compartment, ostensibly for a weekend excursion, and is later discovered brutally murdered for her valuable and now-missing jewels. Poirot is called in by the girl's distraught father to ferret out the killer while Inspector Jap of Scotland Yard remains typically befuddled. [6.5]Wasp's Nest -- The intellectual and refined son of one of Poirot's old acquaintances is affianced to an attractive and well-known model who is clearly bearing the burden of a past dark secret. Poirot and Hastings visit the privileged son and, while there, the master detective sniffs out a murder case... one which has yet to happen! Inspector Japp is notably inconvenienced by appendicitis as a sub-plot. [7.5]VOLUME 2 (Disc Two)The Tragedy at Marsden Manor -- Marsden Manor harbors the ghost of a young girl which haunts the vicinity of a gigantic and ancient cedar tree on the estate; however, the Lord of the manor doesn't buy into this yarn although he is sympathetic to his young wife's chilling encounters with the apparition. Very soon the discovery of his corpse found lying beneath the tree's canopy seems to confirm the ghost's presence as well as its efficacy. Through a comedy of errors, Poirot and Hastings find themselves in the vicinity of this sleepy little hamlet and the two are consequently pulled into the case, (luckily for Inspector Japp!) The sordid and dreary lady book-keeper of the estate seems a nasty piece of work but Poirot maintains an open mind. [9]The Double Clue -- Here, the screenwriters didn't bother to modify one of Christie's well-known original titles:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Double-Clue/dp/B001RMWAV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Double Clue</a>.This is an unusual episode as Poirot immediately loses his heart to a dubious but attractive Russian Countess. Then Poirot discovers that, at a series of elite parties where the Countess has been in attendance, valuable jewels have come up missing. The pressure is turned up on a very depressed Chief Inspector Japp to break the case but Poirot unexplainably declines any interest in helping him to resolve his career-busting demise. Miss Lemon and Captain Hastings thus take up the baton, deciding to pursue the facts of the case and Hastings is nearly killed as a result! [6.5]The Mystery of the Spanish Chest -- Is the lovely wife of a jealous man about to be murdered? A mutual acquaintance of both this lovely lady and Poirot believes that it is so. Poirot attends a party in pursuit of more clues and he is astonished when Inspector Japp later informs him that the jealous husband has been found at the party house inside an old Spanish chest, the obvious victim of a murderer! This episode features terrific co-stars including Peter Copley (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fall-of-Eagles/dp/B000EMGF2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fall of Eagles</a>) as Burgoyne, the stereotypical English butler; John McEnry (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Dorrit/dp/B001PU8N0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Dorrit</a>) as Colonel Curtiss; and, John Noble (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Return-of-the-King-Platinum-Series-Special-Extended-Edition/dp/B000634DCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a>) who plays Rigoletto. [9]VOLUME 3 Disc Three)The Theft of the Royal Ruby -- A flashy woman steals a priceless Egyptian ruby from a rowdy Prince of that realm. As a caveat of the theft, British interests in the Suez Canal are at stake so while Poirot despises the Prince's flamboyant behavior he still takes on the case. His chief suspect is soon tracked down and found to be in association with a prominent archaeologist who resides in the English countryside. Under an arranged pretense, a Christmas invitation is extended to Poirot who probes the estate for clues during his brief stay -- the ruby is found almost inadvertently but the crime remains unsolved as far as discovering the identity of the thief -- the Prince demands further investigation. Lots of terrific atmosphere is generated but the mansion remarkably resembles the one seen in *The Double Clue*. [8]The Affair at the Victory Ball -- A gaggle of BBC Radio actors, one of whom being quite wealthy, all attend a New Year's costume ball dressed as Harlequin and company. When the rich actor, (who is also a noted collector of rare China), is brutally stabbed to death, Poirot is faced with deciphering a crime where all the suspects were shrouded in full disguise during the evening of murder. This is one of Christie's most formulaic yarns, much akin to the works of R. Austin Freeman:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Thorndike-Mysteries-Collection-Volume-One-Four-Books-in-One-Volume/dp/B001FB5ST6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Thorndike Mysteries Collection, Volume One (Four Books in One Volume!)</a>. [6.5]The Mystery of Hunter's Lodge -- A quarrelsome old Uncle sustains a hand wound from the shotgun of an inexperienced member of a large hunting party as the group blasts away at fly-by grouse on the winter moor. Back at the lodge, ill feelings continue to fester as Poirot, still freezing from his unpleasant outdoor experience as an onlooker, decides to retreat to his nearby hotel bed where Hastings looks after his ill friend. That very night a stranger appears at the lodge and puts a permanent end to the crusty old Uncle's rambling repertoire of bragging and carping! This episode features the superb atmosphere which manifests the very Hallmark of the classic Golden Age British Mystery. At 9.5, this is easily the most compelling episode of the set.These Poirot episodes were first aired on PBS station broadcasts in 1991. The total run time for each disc (of which there are three) is 153 minutes (just over 50 minutes per episode.)

"It could have been great.  It's based on an amazing story of honor and duty, but it turned into supernatural drivel that also had Keanu Reeves.

"This is a story about love between two adults. The casting is excellent, never seen Colin Firth looking better; handsome and talented. Tom Ford's first effort is superb. Loved the film and the soundtrack. Bought it on iTunes when I got home from seeing the film at the Harvard Exit Theater in Seattle. This is my favorite Colin Firth film, and I was very pleased he was nominated for the Oscar. I can see why it went to Jeff Bridges, has nothing to do with his performance being better than Colin's. That's not how the Oscar's work. Two different styles of films, two wonderful performances from leading men. Hollywood executives ""market"" for awards. Colin attended the Oscar hype events looking dashing and his wife looking beautiful. Jeff attended the same events with his beautiful wife but he is from this town and clearly it was time to give the Dude the statue. I was glad for him.Both stars have a lot to be proud of. I do wish Tom Ford had gotten the best director nod. It certainly was not an easy film to direct. Jeff went bar hopping in Santa Fe, far less demanding but he rose to the challenge of the role.

It takes a special kind of talent to be able to do the ""Vamp"" thing and look right into the camera lens.

"The World Is Not Enough isn't quite bad.  It's just...bland.  After the dizzying high of GoldenEye and a fairly strong showing in Tomorrow Never Dies (Jonathan Pryce's awful performance excluded), the franchise was looking on the up and up.  The World Is Not Enough doesn't fulfill theexpectations, however; a swirl of bad choices and too much style-over-substance make this the weakest Bond film since the Roger Moore days.Pierce Brosnan shows his weak spots as an actor in this film.  The prospect of James Bond and M (dependable Judi Dench) being challenged in their moral stance is just rift with possibilities, but director Michael Apted was content with just scratching the surface of the dilemma; Brosnan, saddled with the character's guilt complex, is unable to surpass more than just a couple of puppy-dog guilty looks, and thus damages the character's credibility.  Of course, Dench and Brosnan are not helped by an atypically erratic, shallow performance by Sophie Marceau.  She is quite pretty and has shown ability in the past, but in this world, she flutters between screaming, hysterical weakling and icy, sadistic maneater with no conviction.  It's not an easy mix to begin with, and Marceau just doesn't pass the mustard.  Denise Richards is of course just a token pretty face in here, ""Dr. Christmas Jones"" easily the most laughable Bond girl in the last 20 years.  When Apted tries to make us take her seriously, the ludicrous nature of the casting choice and script sink his intentions, and when he tries to bury her into the background, it merely points out that the character is window dressing.Robert Carlyle, thankfully, offers up some solace on the acting front, projecting a more human, wounded sensibility into his terrorist character.  He, too, is relegated to the sidelines, inexplicably, in favour of the much weaker Marceau.After the pretty outrageous initial chase (where high hopes of Il Postino's Maria Grazia Cuchinotta becoming a Bond girl are dashed), the action sequences also fall low.  The ending of The World Is Not Enough is an all-time low, a vacuous attempt at a hand-to-hand fight sequence sabotaged by bad staging and shooting.  I sure hope the next Bond will pull the franchise back up, because this is  one of Bond's weakest moments.",1024444800,"06 19, 2002",2.0,-1

"I'll skip my usual plot summary, as doing so would cause me to lose the will to live. Suffice to say, Your Highness is a stoner comedy where brothers Danny McBride and James Franco have to team up to take on the evil wizard (Justin Theroux) in order to save the kidnapped Zooey Deschanel. A bewildered Natalie Portman helps out for a bit. Suffice to say the good guys win.Your Highness is a movie that catastrophically fails on numerous levels. First up, it's a stoner comedy which is trying to make the 'add marijuana use to any given scene to make it using' formulae still work. The conceit here is that the film is a high fantasy, so characters breaking out weed whilst on a quest to save the world (or at least the female lead's virginity) is supposed to be tonally jarring and hence amusing. The problem, of course, is that even the serious Lord of the Rings movies had weed jokes in them, so this doesn't really work.Secondly, the film's leads are rather unlikeable. Danny McBride (also the film's writer) plays Danny McBride, the quintessential supporting man who is best-deployed in short bursts (he worked quite well blowing up an entire jungle in Tropic Thunder and then doing nothing else of note in the film). He can't handle the lead role for an entire movie, and his jokes become repetitive and fall flat. He has occasional moments of competence, but no more. Worse is Franco, who plays his flamboyant, heroic role with all the charisma of a wet blanket, not to mention adopting a bizarre nasal accent that is seriously annoying. Completing a trio of ineptness, Deschanel plays her role as if she is severely concussed for the whole movie, a curious choice from someone who is actually a very good actress.Supporting actors fare better: Theroux's ferocious, scenery-chewing performance is just what the script calls for and he makes even the most tired gross-out gags amusing. He also gets the best lines. It's therefore a shame he gets relatively little screen-time. Charles Dance, playing the brothers' fierce, authoritarian father (trivia: he was recruited straight from the set of Your Highness to play Tywin Lannister in Game of Thrones), also succeeds by playing his role straight. But again, he's in the film for only a limited period. Portman is more variable, in some scenes phoning it in and in others at least trying to get into the spirit of things. Portman went straight from filming Your Highness to principal photography on Black Swan, which I suspect was a tonal shift so jarring it caused whiplash.We must take a brief moment to salute Toby Jones, an excellent and interesting actor who in Your Highness has to utterly humiliate himself several times over in the pursuit of McBride's comedic vision, and does so without at any time descending into a towering rage and murdering his co-star with a chainsaw. Such restraint can only be marvelled at.Another major failing of the film is that it seems to draw inspiration from other, superior movies. When a film is making you think of The Princess Bride, Lord of the Rings or Krull, it's probably not a good idea for the film not to be a patch on any of them.Your Highness ( a star and lucky to get that) is not particularly fantastical (having a paedophile muppet wizard doesn't count), definitely not original, is mostly utterly unfunny (some honourable exceptions for Theroux) and almost everyone involved seems to be rather embarrassed by the project. The studio certainly was, sitting on it for more than a year before finally trotting it out somewhat sheepishly to the cinemas, where it promptly bombed. Definitely one to avoid.",1327881600,"01 30, 2012",1.0,-1

"Ok. I saw this flick when it came out in 1996. On first viewing it isn't so bad. Then when you go the distance and take notice of how awful the acting and storyline are, you have a rude awakening. The word to describe this film is 'annoying'. The acting is annoying. The forever worn out and severly lame 'Lover's-Quarrel-But-Everyone-Gets-Back-Together-In-The-End' sub plot is annoying. The 'bad guys' driving black vehicles and having that ever politically incorrect 'corporate backing' (how dare they?!) is annoying. The one liners are annoying. The fact that every tornado is refered to as 'she' or 'her' is annoying. The fact that the homemade weather station named 'Dorothy' is refered to as 'she' or 'her' is annoying. The final scene with the main characters tying themselves up inside a decrepit shack and end up flying around safely inside an F-5 tornado is annoying. Bill Paxton's rotten acting and 'intense' monotone voice (who told this guy he could act?) plus Helen Hunt's usual terrible acting are annoying. The scene where everyone freezes and look at each other when the reference to an 'F-5 tornado' is mentioned and is refered to as 'The Finger Of God' is annoying. Trucks driving through houses, the main 'bad guy' getting sucked up into the F-5 after ignoring Paxton's warnings, Bill Paxton telling Helen Hunt that he is still in love with her while his 'wife to be' hears the conversation over the CB radio, Helen Hunt's 'death Wish' by confronting each tornado, one of the professional storm chasers deciding to take cover in a truck while a tornado is coming (even I know not to do that!), the little plastic piece of junk 'sensors' rigged with sliced up soda cans for propellers being sucked up into the tornado and are not pulverized, the fact that all the domestic animals that are shown somehow survive (Hollywood seems to have no problem showing people being mauled but heaven forbid a down home pet gets wiped out), the fact that the scene following the destruction of the drive in theater in Wakita is not included (was it ever shot?) are all ANNOYING! Good points: opening scene where the Helen Hunt character's father is sucked into an F-5 tornado, tornado destroying the drive in theater, 18 wheeler being thrown at the main characters truck, the final tornado wiping out a large barn and the 5.1 surround sound. Based on these points alone, I give this film two points. A note to the producers for a follow up: Do your science homework. Lay off the played out love story sub plot, good guys versus the bad guys nonsense and hire some good actors!",1053561600,"05 22, 2003",2.0,-1

"This film, originally released in 1968 and reissued by Criterion in a two-disc set, is a fascinating look inside moviemaking. Or is it? The beauty of it is that you never know for sure. Alleging to be following the shooting of a film in Central Park, the narrative sways from actual footage of the actors to b-roll of the surrounding crowd to behind-the-scenes dramas among the cast and crew. You're never certain which thread is supposed to be the 'real' one, or if in fact any of them are real, or if the whole thing is staged (even the 'candid' material). The artifice of the cinema, and at the same time its ability to redefine reality, are exposed. Everything seems fascinating and banal, relevant and irrelevant, all at the same time. It's amazing to watch, and provides an interesting commentary on some of the pretensions of the cinema verite movement. I've really never seen anything else like it. And, as usual, the Criterion print is beautiful. And even if you don't enjoy the film, this package is still worth buying for the documentary on William Greaves (the director in the film), who has produced an incredible range of documentaries throughout his career.",1214784000,"06 30, 2008",5.0,1

"Boy, I must have read the wrong review before I saw this.  I went in expecting a Serious Movie, but instead, this is a rom-com hiding behind the scrims of depression, OCD, and bipolar disorder.  I guess pulling off mild comedy behind those topics displays a certain deftness, but it doesn't make this movie historically great, either.  De Niro is clearly here to raise financing for the film, which means he can mail in a variant of his increasingly-standarized post-Meet-the-Fockers persona.  The whole pro-football-as-obsession side story is as pathetic here as it is in real life (and I say that as an NFL fan!).  Still, on the plus side, the byplay between Cooper and Lawrence--the main reason for the film--is very well done, and there is no doubt that Lawrence is the Real Thing as an actress.",1377475200,"08 26, 2013",3.0,0

"I should perhaps start by saying that I rarely watch a series of anything, but I started to watch this one, and then, promptly, ""couldn't put it down."" The costumes, scenery, clothing and automobiles, though true to the period, become almost a footnote to the drama and relationships which ensue. From 1905, when the series starts, up to  the story's cliffhanger on New Year's Eve of 1907, one is taken on a journey of intrique, jealousy, passion, power, manipulation and murder. The powerful and woven storylines pale, however, compared to the passion and romance throughout the series,none so intense, involved and lasting as Alicia and Julio's. Up to this point, this can all be seen on Netflix,comprising the first 2 seasons in Spanish with subtitles. The third and last season can be seen on YouTube, without subtitles.Unbelievably, all the passion, intrigue and plot twists work. One starts with a very rigid caste system, which slowly evolves as Alicia and Julio begin their passionate friendship, as Alicia is grudgingly asked to help Julio find his missing sister, who was last heard from as she worked in the Hotel. With very few kisses in between, their relationship is finally consumated in chapter 26, about 35 hours into the story. Another perhaps 60 hours of viewing later, their three year relationship has shifted so many relationships that when they publicly kiss one another on the balcony of the hotel, everyone smiles, even the Matriach of the family and the head housekeeper. At this point, only the guests are shocked to see a highborn woman kissing a waiter, something that until that point had been painstakingly avoided, as all clandestine relationships usually are.This is not, however a Wuthering Heights or a Pride and Prejudice, though it certainly has some of their best features. There are dozens of characters, in addition to the Alarcon family, and enough plot twists to keep the most fidgetty person rivetted to the Spanish countryside. It's intelligent and sentively played. Even though there are too many unexpected plots to mention, the story doesn't become labored, boring, trite or predictable. Julio and Alicia are gorgeous, but have depth besides chemistry. Jon Gonzales,as Julio, who was once a model, is given a fantastic haircut, which is short and modern in the back, but gives him a thick mane in front with a prominant cowlick. This works beautifully, just one of thousands of details which work in the story. I'm quite sure the actors had bittersweet feelings about ending the series, just as I did when I read Gone With the Wind more than 20 years ago. To me, this is far better.There are those who are watching the 3rd season, not understanding the Spanish,yet too umpatient to wait until it is produced with English subtitles... I believe that says it all !",1407110400,"08 4, 2014",5.0,1

"This one is a killer-diller! Wow! The person who recommended this one to me deserves a medal. Hodejegerne, an R-rated Norwegian crime thriller (English captions), is exciting, involving, unpredictable and intelligent. It has relatable characters, a wonderful plot and is beautifully acted. We in the audience left the theater happily talking to ourselves.A skilled art thief hears of a priceless Rubens, stolen during WWII and kept in a private collection all these years. He realizes this could be the deal that puts him and his wife on easy street for the rest of their lives. Thus begins our story.We see:  * Aksel Hennie (""Age of Heroes"") is our pint-sized cat burglar, impeccably groomed, smart as a whip and always trying to improve his theft of high-end art. His day job is to find and interview applicants for new executive positions.  * Synnve Macody Lund (TV roles) is his statuesque wife, blonde, successful and longing to have a baby. She owns an art gallery.  * Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (""Game of Thrones"") is a former hi-tech special ops guy who wants the job as CEO of a company our hero represents. He has come to Norway to settle his aunt's estate.  * Eivind Sander (""Cupid's Balls"") is our hero's fence and inside man for those pesky burglar alarms. Problem is, he rarely uses the brain in his big head. He and his libido entertain thousands on the Internet.  * Reidar Srensen (""Home for Christmas"") is the brilliant and politically astute detective who gets involved in the situation.This fast-moving plot sucks you in before you know it. There is tension, surprise, and impressive use of modern technology: GPS, cell phones and the Internet. Expect guns, knives, cars, trucks, attack dogs, and a farm tractor, plus a couple of really gross bits. There is little or no profanity or blowie uppie stuff. The two antagonists are Norwegian versions of the Energizer Bunny: they just won't quit! And I LOVE watching smart people try to outwit other smart people.This comes out on DVD at Amazon on 08-28-12.

"Directed by Jay Roach (Austin Powers, Meet the Parents) from a screenplay by John McNamara (Eyes, Fastlane) adapted from the book Dalton Trumbo by Bruce Cook, Trumbo is the story of Dalton Trumbo, one of the most brilliant screenwriters Hollywood ever produced, who was blacklisted in the 1940's and 50's because of his refusal to cooperate with the Congressional investigation/witch-hunt for communists in the movie industry.It would take a long time to properly explain the situation what existed in the US in the period following the end of WWII and the Cold War that took its place. The short version is that in those years the US succumbed to a paranoia that communists in America were all agents for the Soviet Union and were working to undermine and eventually overthrow democracy here, and because of that anyone who had ever been a communist or had ever associated with anyone who was a communist was deemed suspect.  A particular focus of this paranoia came to bear on Hollywood where it was believed communists were using the film industry to subtly spread communist propaganda. As a result, Congress, specifically the House Un-American Activities Committee, subpoenaed ten screenwriters suspected of communist involvement to testify as part of their investigation.  Trumbo was one of those ten.  Feeling that the investigation was a violation of the First Amendment right to freedom of expression, the ""Hollywood Ten"" as they came to be known refused to cooperate, which resulted in them ultimately being fined and sent to prison for contempt of Congress.  They were also ""blacklisted"" in Hollywood which made it impossible for them to find employment. Their treatment caused others who were later subpoenaed to be more cooperative and many ended up giving up names of people they knew or suspected of involvement with the communist party, including friends and associates in the film industry that they had known and worked with for years.  It was a very dark time and many people's lives and careers were destroyed as a result.  This film does a good job of showing what that involved, how it worked, and how it made people turn on each other out of fear. And how some people unscrupulously manipulated that atmosphere of fear for their own purposes.The direction and screenwriting in Trumbo are, to be honest, workmanlike, adequate to the task of conveying events but seldom hitting the high bar in terms of really moving you. The performances are what really make Trumbo work. A lot of attention has been paid - deservedly - to Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad, Malcolm in the Middle)'s audaciously eloquent and increasingly driven Dalton Trumbo and Helen Mirren (Hitchcock, The Queen) 's superficially patriotic but insidiously venomous Hedda Hopper, but there are a number of other supporting performances that really flesh things out and give depth and feeling to the people caught up in this turbulent period and how they reacted to it.  Diane Lane (Unfaithful, Under the Tuscan Sun) does a fine job as Cleo Trumbo, Dalton's quietly supportive but pushed-to-her-limits wife. Elle Fanning (Super 8, Maleficent) shines as the teenaged Niki Trumbo who chafes and ultimately rebels at the way her father's life has consumed everyone else's in the family, only for them both to realize that she's very much cut from the same stubborn moral mold as he is.  Veteran character actor John Goodman particularly stands out as B-movie producer Frank King who hired Trumbo to write for him - admittedly by using various fronts to cover the fact - when no one else would give him work.  Goodman delivers King in grand form, stealing every scene he's in and has some of the best scenes and lines in the film.  Dean O'Gorman (The Hobbit) does an excellent job portraying the actor Kirk Douglas who was instrumental in helping end the blacklist by openly giving Trumbo writing credit for his epic film Spartacus. And Christian Berkel (Inglourious Bastards, Downfall) does an equally excellent job as the imperious director Otto Preminger who was also instrumental in ending the blacklist by openly giving Trumbo writing credit for his film Exodus.One exception to the overall fine performances however is Michael Stuhlbarg (Boardwalk Empire, A Serious Man) as Edward G. ""Eddie"" Robinson.  An otherwise fine actor, in Trumbo Stuhlbarg never came across believably as Robinson, in no small part because he completely lacked Robinson's highly distinctive voice and way of speaking, one of the best known and immediately recognizable voices in Hollywood history, even when not doing one of his much imitated gangster roles. Also unfortunately for Stuhlbarg, the script was highly unfair to Robinson as it had him naming names before HUAC, something the real-life Edward G. Robinson never did.  Another problem comes from  two composite characters, both of whom came across as overdone.  Louis C.K. (Louie) plays a screenwriter named Arlen Hird, a more ideological and committed communist in contrast to Trumbo's socially conscious one, and Roger Bart (Desperate Housewives) plays an opportunistic producer named Buddy Ross who caves under pressure to the blacklist.  There was no need for composite characters when so many real-life figures were available to use, and as written these characters seem to exist solely to spout dialogue and feel distinctly out of place among all of the real-life people being portrayed in the film.On the plus side, Trumbo makes effective use of actual film footage and radio recordings from the period of statements and testimonies given by major Hollywood and political figures on both sides, from the infamous Senator Joe McCarthy and Ronald Reagan when he was president of the Screen Actors Guild to Lucille Ball, Gregory Peck and JFK.Highly recommended for its outstanding performances and for bringing to the screen what it was like for people who were blacklisted during that shameful period of American history.",1451260800,"12 28, 2015",4.0,1
"I hate to say this but do yourself a big favor and avoid this movie at all costs.  I meant to see this in the theater since I'm a huge fan of the series, bought them all on DVD then blu-ray, but it only lasted a week or so in town before it was removed so I had to wait until the blu-ray release, so I've been anxiously waiting to finally watch it.  I should've rented it instead of pre-ordering.  Talk about one of the biggest disappointments in cinematic history, and a huge waste of my time and money.I watched this tonight with a friend of mine who's also a big fan of the series, and sadly we were laughing our way through this film at all the unintentionally funny scenes that were simply too cheesy or ludicrous even for this series.  It took about half an hour into it before it began making even a semblance of any sense, but even then there were still enough plot holes to fill the Titanic.I haven't played the games hardly at all, so I came into this series because it looked intriguing but I didn't have any pre-conceived notions of what they should be like or about, whereas most of the games' fans dislike the films because they're not close to the game story-line at all.  I came in with an open mind and I've been pleasantly surprised by all of these movies, up until this one.  I even researched the Internet Movie Database to try to figure out what the heck happened to take a popular, well-established franchise and then completely screw up the story, but I haven't really found any answers other than seeing that my voice isn't alone on this.There's really no character development to speak of, which there was plenty of in the previous films.  There are numerous old characters that come back for no apparent reason, it's explained but it serves little purpose other than tarnishing the memory of their original characters.  It seriously feels like Paul Anderson spent five minutes on writing this 'script' just to quickly cash in on its popularity, because it really doesn't hold a candle to the previous plot lines, characters, dialogue or intrigue.  The plot in 'Retribution' is so convoluted it makes 'Crime & Punishment' look succinct by comparison.About the only redeeming features of the film is the HD cinematography and many of the action sequences.  There are quite simply too many things that are deus ex machina, essentially factors thrown in at random with no discernible explanation for how they came to be.  Granted this series requires a major amount of suspending one's disbelief but it came to the point where it made James Bond movies look plausible.  There were (what looked like) Nazi zombies riding jeeps and zombies from the deep, homages perhaps to old B-movie slasher flicks of the 70s and 80s but completely out of context for this series.It's the first movie of this series where I didn't care one way or the other of how any of it would turn out, or what happened to any of them, because there was no reason to.  The movie moved aimlessly all over the map with no end in sight, and not all that entertaining, either.To make matters worse, the ending was beyond stupid.  Completely nonsensical, over-the-top B-movie ending, with no logical addition to the series.  In terms of cliff-hangers, this one 'jumped the shark', so to speak, in other words it's so completely out of sync with the overall story that it boggles the mind and almost begs to be put out of its misery.How this movie came to be without a serious re-write or questioning by studio-execs will forever remain a mystery (perhaps there is an answer out there, I'd really like to know), or it was simply just out to make a quick buck, of course, but even that doesn't really answer it because the others were huge money makers AND were quite well made, by the same writer/director/producer, no less.  Sadly this will be the last of this series that I will buy without seeing it first, and if there are any more, which Anderson has said there will be, I will definitely only rent it this time around, because this was an unfortunate waste of my time and money and I won't bother to see it again, it's that bad.  Huge, huge disappointment, all the way around, it's really hard to believe it was made by the same guy.  I kind of suspect he hired a ghost writer for this script and just put his name on it, because the difference in quality is night and day.On the bright side I'll take comfort in the fact that I can re-watch the first 4 films on blu-ray and I'll just pretend that this epic failure of a film wasn't made.",1356220800,"12 23, 2012",1.0,-1

"**1/2If you've already seen ""Black Beauty,"" ""National Velvet"" or ""My Friend Flicka,"" you might want to take a pass on ""Moondance Alexander,"" a wan girl-and-her-horse saga that doesn't even have the energy or conviction to rise above its own clichs.Moondance is a ninth-grade social outcast who finds meaning and purpose in life when she spends the summer taking care of and learning to ride a horse owned by a cantankerous but lovable Pygmalion played by Don Johnson (think of it as an equine version of ""My Fair Lady,"" minus the songs and quality).  The first credibility obstacle we have to overcome is accepting the spunky and attractive Moondance as a girl who can't find herself a single friend (well, the two-legged type anyway).The paint-by-numbers screenplay comes replete with a miraculous horse healing, a bevy of Valley Girl elitists straight out of Central Casting, and a horse-jumping competition that has all the drama and suspense of a Tiddlywinks tournament in Oshkosh.Ah well, at least the movie boasts, in the person of Kay Panabaker, a young actress with a great deal of charm and potential.  And, besides, where else are you going to hear a line like, ""Moondance, I want you to take Checkers over to the stables,"" if not in this film?

I absolutely love this show.  If you enjoy Broadway musicals then please buy this.  If the sales are good it might convince them to release more Broadway shows this way which would be awesome.  There are several great musical numbers.  The only bad thing about it is that the character of Donkey is much more annoying than he was in the movie and there's too much dialogue that's taken word for word from the movie which really isn't necessary.

"As soon as I saw this title and the ads, something told me that this HAD to be a korean remake. Let's face it. That's all we see these days at the multi-plex. If not a Korean remake, then a sequel to a long-ago classic--like Terminator, Halloween, Star Trek, Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Today's Hollywood has no idea on how to make an original thriller--so they give us junk like this. Sure enough, I did discover that this movie was a korean remake and I wonder if there are any more horror films made by Koreans to feed the zestful appetite of HOllywood? In this movie, there's nothing remotely horrible.You have vapid performers who are not very attractive and they always end up doing stupid things.  I wish we could get a mature, talented actress--like Naomi Watts who made a remake of ""The Ring""--in the main role. this movie appears geared for the teeney-bopper crowd because most of the main characters are all teenagers.Let's hope that one day, we'll get an original, brilliant horror original again--like in those olden days when we were treated to gems like The thing, Psycho, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Alien, etc. Let's not hold our breath.",1243555200,"05 29, 2009",1.0,-1

"We literally waited for years for Disney Planes to come out because we saw the preview on another Disney movie. We went and saw it in the theater but my son didn't really like the 3D effects so we were even more eager for the DVD/Blu-Ray to come out! At last it has arrived!As I suspected, Reed is much more excited about the movie now that he can watch it like normal without the 3D effects. He has watched it over and over again and it has become his new favorite movie. He is already making a list of all the Planes that he wants for Christmas.Personally, I was a bit disappointed as I thought that it was too much like Cars, only with Planes. The storyline was so similar that it lacked originality. Its still well made because its Disney and it has its usual array of colorful amazing characters. I just wish the storyline wasn't much like Cars.Nonetheless, what matters is my kids and they adore it and never once said this reminds me of the movie Cars.

"I was never a big fan of this movie and I wasn't quite sure why? My wife on the other hand loves it and while flipping around the channels looking for something to watch, we happened across this film, and showed it to our kids. I'm pretty sure that everyone knows the plot of this one, and it's entered the public consciousness, but just in case there are a few cave dwellers out there.An obnoxious voice-over artist gets fired from his latest job, and travels over to his kids' school to pick them up so that he can throw his 12-year old son a birthday party, even though his son has been told by their mother, that no party's are allowed. The party soon gets out of hand with petting zoo animals running wild, loud music and police arriving to shut everything down. The mom arrives home in time to see kids literally swinging from the chandeliers, and horses roaming through her living room. She is so furious with her oblivious husband she demands a divorce. Instead of learning anything from his wife or the experience, the actor pouts and places all of the blame on the mother. Being without a job and without a decent place for the kids to live, the actor loses custody of the kids. And unless he can prove that he can hold down a job, then his visitation will be restricted. The mother, needing some help with the kids and house, puts an ad in the paper for a housekeeper. Her now ex-husband sabotages the add, and answers the add himself, dressed in an old woman disguise.I think some age has put into perspective why I never really liked this film. Robin Williams' ""Daniel"" is a horrible person, just completely unlikable. He's a jerk, he's rude, he's awful to the people around him, and he honestly doesn't care. As the film opens we see him wasting thousands of dollars by refusing to stay on script while voicing a cartoon, he the proceeds to throw his wife under the bus by throwing a huge party trashing their house, and then whines when she says she's had enough. Then, instead of securing a job and finding an apartment, he belittles his case worker, refused to clean up his house, and talks trash about his ex-wife to the kids. Then instead of sucking it up, and getting on with his life, he deceives his entire family by showing up in disguise, and then tries to manipulate each of the kids and his ex by insulting the new boyfriend of the mother. Daniel tries to sabotage the relationship at every turn. And, if all of that weren't bad enough, when Daniel does find a new job at the local TV station stockroom, he manages to destroy the career of a long-time TV host by trashing the host's show to the station manager. Daniel deserves none of the good things that happen to him over the course of this film, he's a horrible, manipulative person.With that said, there are some laughs throughout. Williams' does a fantastic job of bringing the titular character to life, and Sally Field is always fun to watch, it's just a shame she's stuck on one-note for most of the film. Pierce Brosnan doesn't get much to do here but play the generic handsome love interest. If ""Daniel"" were played by someone with less charm than Robin Williams, then this film would be unwatchable, but thanks to the manic energy and humor Williams brings to the role, you can't help but get a smile or two.",1433808000,"06 9, 2015",3.0,0

"This drama is so cute. Its a very teen drama and its alot like the manga series. I've seen both the Japanese and the Korean version, but I think my favorite is the Korean one. The cast is great and the show has alot of funny and romantic scenes on it. I saw it online and I knew I had to get it for my own. The episodes show well and the subtitles too. I arrived ahead of time which made me very happy.",1382054400,"10 18, 2013",5.0,1
